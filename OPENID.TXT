Caucus 5.1   Optional OpenId Integration
Last revision: 15 February 2010

I. Introduction
OpenId (http://openid.net) is a sort of mass single-signon project 
that is widespread, open-source, convenient, and relatively safe.  
It involves using a (or setting up your own) OpenId server, that 
users login to.  Once there, their browser gets a cookie that 
OpenId-compliant applications can use to detect a valid login has 
already occurred, and take users straight into the application 
w/o further authentication. 

Caucus supports OpenId's, although it requires some additional
software packages and configuration.  This document describes
the precise steps involved.

II. Install optional development packages
Depending on your specific linux/unix distribution, you
may need to install some optional development packages
and libraries.  For example, on a vanilla CentOS 5.4
distribution, it was necessary to do these additional
installs:

   yum install gcc-c++.i386
   yum install openssl.i386
   yum install openssl-devel.i386
   yum install curl-devel.i386
   yum install expat-devel.i386
   yum install libtidy-devel.i386
   yum install httpd-devel.i386
   yum install sqlite-devel.i386
   yum install pcre-devel.i386
   yum install mysql-devel.i386

III. Install Libopkele

Download and install a 2.x version of libopkele from 
http://kin.klever.net/libopkele/.

You may need to add the (generated) libopkele.pc to the
PKG-CONFIG_PATH.  For more information, execute the command
   pkg-config libopkele --libs

IV. Install the Apache module mod_auth_openid, from
http://trac.butterfat.net/public/mod_auth_openid.

V. Configure your Caucus Apache virtualhost to use
mod_auth_openid.  Assuming, for example, that you have
installed Caucus in /home/caucus, then your virtualhost
file would contain something like this:

   DocumentRoot /home/caucus/public_html
   ScriptAlias /openid/   /home/caucus/OPENID/
   ScriptAlias /swebs/    /home/caucus/SWEB/
   ScriptAlias /reg/      /home/caucus/REG/
   ScriptAlias /caucus/   /home/caucus/REG/start.cgi/
   ScriptAlias /caucus    /home/caucus/REG/start.cgi

   <Directory /home/caucus/SWEB>
      Options All
      AllowOverride All
      allow from all
   </Directory>

   <Directory /home/caucus/OPENID>
      Options All
      AllowOverride All
      allow from all
      AuthOpenIDEnabled  On
      AuthOpenIDLoginPage     /openid.html
   </Directory>

Note in particular the /openid/, /home/caucus/OPENID,
and AuthOpenID... parts.

VI. Using Caucus with OpenId.
Just point your browser at yourcaucushost.com/openid.html,
and login via the (lower) OpenId box.  This assumes that
you already have an OpenId from an OpenId identify provider.

VII. Setting up your own OpenId provider.
This is outside the scope of this document, however, you
can find details for one way of setting up an OpenId
provider at http://thedance.net/~roth/TECHBLOG/openid.html.
