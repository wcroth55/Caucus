Caucus 5.1   Build & Installation Instructions
Last revision: 12 December 2014

I. INTRODUCTION
Caucus is a sophisticated web-based group discussion and e-learning 
tool, with a history that stretches back to 1986.  It provides 
multi-tiered asynchronous discussion groups, classes, assignments,
quizzes, file storage areas, user tracking, and grading, all with a 
high degree of security, flexibility, and customizability.

Caucus runs as a CGI application on top of most web servers 
(such as Apache), and uses MySQL as its data store.

Caucus can run on just about every flavor of Unix.  There was also
(briefly) a Windows NT version, although it is no longer supported
or recommended.  Most of the NT code remains in the code base,
and in theory could be resurrected.

Caucus version 5 was released as "open source" in October 2005, 
and may be used by anyone for any purpose.  It is distributed
in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; 
without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS 
FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  

For more information, see www.caucus.com.  If you are actively
using or testing Caucus, there is a conference (discussion forum)
called "Caucus5 Open Source", specifically for questions and
comments about this build and install procedure.

Caucus is Copyright (C) 1986-2010 CaucusCare.com, a registered DBA
in the state of Michigan of the United States of America.  Version
5 was released under the GPL and the CDDL; see the license.txt
files in the source directories, or the web site, for details.


II. REQUIREMENTS
Caucus requires the following packages:

   1. MySQL  4.1 or higher.  See www.mysql.com.
   2. MySQL development package (libraries and include files)
   3. A web server (Apache is recommended)

Caucus also requires the OpenLDAP libraries, but they are included
(and built from source) by this package.  We currently use OpenLDAP
version 2.3.11.

Caucus can also be configured to use OpenId's; see the separate
document OPENID.TXT for more details.  In that case it will
need additional software libraries installed.


III. OVERVIEW

There are two phases:
  1. Build kit
  2. Install kit

Caucus is frequently installed multiple times on a single box
(each install in its own unix userid as a "virtual host").  Thus 
a "kit" (caucus5.tar) is built once from source, and then 
potentially installed multiple times.


IV. BUILD PHASE

   0. Unpack source and cd to build directory.  (Solaris 9 may require
      gzcat instead of zcat.)

         zcat caucus5.102.102.tar.gz | tar xvf -
         cd   caucus5.102.102

   1. Configure for this operating system.  (Run "./configure --help"
      for a list of options.)

         ./configure

      Currently Linux (Redhat and Debian), Solaris 9, and MacOS X are supported. 
      Other flavors of unix will require only minor changes to the configure
      script.

   2. Build the install kit, in the file caucus5.tar.

         make


V. BUILD PHASE NOTES

   0. Run "./configure --help" to see a list of all configuration options.
      In particular, if your MySQL is installed in an unusual location,
      you may need to set the --mysqllib or --mysqlinc options.

   1. Linux Distributions:

      a. Most RedHat distributions (RHEL, Fedora Core) work
         fine with just "./configure".  64-bit versions should use either
            ./configure --mysqllib=/usr/lib64/mysql/libmysqlclient.a
         or
            ./configure --mysqllib=/usr/lib64/mysql

      b. Debian seems to need:
            ./configure --nosasl2 --nomd5

   2. For RHEL 7 and CentOS 7 on 64 bit systems, we recommend:
            export CPPFLAGS="-D_GNU_SOURCE"
            ./configure --nosasl2 --mysqllib=/usr/lib64/mysql/libmysqlclient.so \
               --otherlib=/lib64/libcrypto.so

   3. For Solaris and MacOSX, we recommend
            ./configure

   4. If you get a fatal error message during the build that says
      "storage size of peercred isn't known", do:

           export CPPFLAGS="-D_GNU_SOURCE"
           ./configure
           make

   5. If you have problems linking Caucus, see the file
      CV2/sweb/makefile (produced by configure), and edit 
      the list of libraries to match the locations on your system.  
      Please let us know what you did, and we will incorporate 
      the necessary changes in the next release.

   6. If you have difficulty linking with LDAP, or if the LDAP
      compilation fails (during configure or make), wipe everything
      and start with a fresh build, and use "./configure --noldap".
      (This disables the LDAP authentication options... but very few
      people use them anyway.)


VI. INSTALL PHASE

   1. Create two unix userids, e.g. "caucus" and "caucus_mail"
      at /home/caucus and /home/caucus_mail.  Caucus_mail and
      caucus must share the same, unique, group.  For example:

         useradd -u 555 -d /home/caucus                caucus
         useradd -u 556 -d /home/caucus_mail -g caucus caucus_mail

      The second userid *must* be the first userid + "_mail".  However,
      the second userid is only required if you intend to support 
      the Caucus "email participation" features.

   2. Select a virtual hostname (if possible), e.g. caucus.yourserver.com.

   3. Login to "caucus".

   4. tar xvf /wherever-you-put/caucus5.tar

   5. ./install
      (Follow the instructions.  You will need the root MySQL password.
      For the first install of Caucus on a server, accept the defaults
      when offered.  Use the virtual hostname from step 2.)

   6. /home/caucus/SWEB/swebd /home/caucus/SWEB/swebd.conf
      (Starts the Caucus "daemon" process.)

      For a permanent installation, you should set Caucus up to be 
      started at boot time.  Add something like the following to
      /etc/rc.d/rc.local (or equivalent start-up script):

         rm -f /home/caucus/SOCKET/sweb
         rm -f /home/caucus/SOCKET/sweb0*
         /home/caucus/SWEB/swebd  /home/caucus/SWEB/swebd.conf

   7. Configure your web server.  For Apache, the best approach is
      to define a virtual host as below:

      <VirtualHost your-ipaddress>
         ServerName caucus.yourserver.com
         DocumentRoot /home/caucus/public_html

         <Directory /home/caucus/SWEB>
            Options All
            AllowOverride All
            allow from all
            Require all granted
         </Directory>
         
         <Directory /home/caucus/REG>
            Options All
            AllowOverride All
            allow from all
            Require all granted
         </Directory>
         
         <Directory /home/caucus/public_html>
            Options -Indexes
         </Directory>
         
         ScriptAlias  /sweb/   /home/caucus/SWEB/
         ScriptAlias  /reg/    /home/caucus/REG/
         
      </VirtualHost>

   8. Restart (or reload) your web server.

   9. Test Caucus.  Point your browser at http://caucus.yourserver.com,
      and click on "New User Registration".  Register yourself as the
      "primary manager" userid that you supplied (in response to the
      install script prompt) in step 5.

  10. If Caucus does not run, create an empty file called "debug" in
      the SOCKET directory.  Then try stopping, restarting, and entering
      Caucus.  You should see several .log files in the SOCKET directory
      that will contain more information.

  11. Configure Caucus email participation features.  Like step 1, this 
      is only required if you intend to use these features.  This step must
      be done once (and only once!), regardless of how many separate installs
      of Caucus you have on your server.

      a. Create a userid, e.g. "nosuchuser", that is to be used to receive
         (and forward) email that is sent to non-existent addresses.

      b. Configure postfix (or sendmail or whatever) to send all email
         for non-existent users, to this userid.  For example, in postfix,
         just add lines at the bottom of /etc/postfix/main.cf that say 

            luser_relay = nosuchuser
            local_recipient_maps =

         Then restart the postfix service.

      c. Login as 'nosuchuser', and type:

            /home/caucus/SCRIPTS/makeForwardCaucusMail

         This will setup a forwarding filter so that all email bound for
         Caucus items goes to the right place.  Any other "junk" email
         will be discarded.

      
VII. PLUG-INS.

   1. When uploading & attaching files to a discussion, Caucus uses the
      "free" version of XUpload to show an optional progress meter.
      (Thank you, SibSoft!)

      You may also purchase a license for the professional version of
      XUpload from their website, at a cost of (May 2011) US $37.
      See http://www.sibsoft.net/xupload.html.

      If you have the professional license, we will provide you,
      at no charge, the modified files needed to fully
      integrate it with Caucus.  Contact info@caucus.com.
      The professional license includes the ability to upload
      multiple files simultaneously from a single page.
