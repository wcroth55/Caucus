     On a lighter note, this item describes an application of
     conferencing to elementary school education.&nbsp;    The host
     computer is located at the University of Virginia.
 
     <P>
     Note that this item was originally from a text-only
     conference; as Caucus evolves, it keeps complete
     upward compatibility.&nbsp;  
     Of course, if this conference were going on today, using
     Caucus on the Web, the kids
     could see pictures and hear the sounds of the sheep
     in question!

 Hi!&nbsp;  I am the organizer of a Caucus application at the
 University of Virginia called KIDLINK (and also a doctoral
 student in Instructional Technology at UVA's Curry School of
 Education).&nbsp;    KIDLINK began in April, 1988.&nbsp;    The first
 participants were 2 fifth grade classes (1 from each of our 2
 local schools systems).&nbsp;    Now we are in the process of adding
 more classes, including classes for hearing impaired children.
 (Just think, you don't have to be able to hear in order to
 effectively telecommunicate!)
 
 <P>
 One of our goals for KIDLINK is to motivate students to write
 (and read).&nbsp;    Usually kids write because they have an assignment
 to turn in, which their teacher will read.&nbsp;    On KIDLINK they can
 write things for their peers to read!&nbsp;  Thus, they can experience
 writing as communication (in a novel and interesting way).
 
 
 <P>
 Below are responses from one of the items from KIDLINK.&nbsp;    Before
 reading it you should know that Ms. W's class was studying a
 unit
 on Indians, which included the raising of sheep.&nbsp;    Mr. B
 happened
 to own a farm and had a baby lamb.&nbsp;    Ms. W arranged (on e-mail)
 to
 actually have Mr. B's lamb in school for a day.
 
 <P>
 Following the responses about the lamb are some final comments
 about KIDLINK from both teachers and a few students.

 THE SHEEP IS VERY LITTLE.  SARAH HAS TO FEED IT WITH A BOTTLE.  
 SHE SAID SHE LIKES THE SHEEP.  SHE SAID SHE WANTS TO KEEP IT  
 FOR GOOD.  I THINK THE SHEEP IS VERY PRETTY.  ONLY THING I HATE  
 IS THE NAME.  WE THINK THAT IT IS FUN TO HAVE THE SHEEP.  WHEN  
 WE CAME TO THE CLASS EVERY FIFTH GRADE CLASS WAS COMING TO SEE
 THE SHEEP.

 I THINK SHEEP ARE GOOD AND NICE ANIMALS.  THEY ARE WARM KIND  
 ANIMALS.  THE LAMB IS SOFT AND FUZZY.  I LIKE LUCY.

 Mr. B, I think your lamb is really neat.  Sarah named her Lucy. 
 Bye!!  Bobbi Jo

 WE ALL THINK THE LAMB IS CUTE BUT SARAH KEEPS ON PICKING HER UP
 FOR NO REASON.  I DO NOT KNOW WHY THEY NAMED HER LUCY.  LUCY IS  
 A STUPID NAME.  IF HER NAME IS LUCY WHERE IS RICKY? I LIKE THE
 LAMB BUT LUCY IS STILL A STUPID NAME.  PERSONALLY I WOULD HAVE
 NAMED HER PEE-WEE LAMBEN.  SHE IS A PRETTY LAMB.  I HATE THE  
 NAME LUCY BUT I LIKE THE LAMB.  WE ARE HAVING LEG OF LAMB TODAY
 FOR LUNCH, AND SOME JUICY LAMB CHOPS.  TONY

 This is from the teacher - Having a lamb in your room is really
 very nice.  She is very well behaved.  She gives new meaning to
 the phrase "gentle as  a lamb."  She never really did anything
 to disrupt class at all except wet the carpet a couple of
 times.  I recommend a lamb at school for anyone.  It's amazing
 that the technology of an electronic mail system got us
 something like a lamb!!!!

 What did you do to Lucy?  Ever since she got back to the farm
 she has been eating like a pig.  We like the name ok.  Mr. B

 Thanks for the wonderful Item from KIDLINK, Sue.  (It's a
 pleasant addition!)  Tell us more about how it was organized:
 pc's in classrooms?  Is that common or hard to come by?
 Did it take the children long to catch on?  They surely 
 seemed to enjoy it.

 Sue, What an amazing idea..I wish they offered Caucus to us when we
 were children.. It must be better than "Pen Pals"..  Good luck, and
 let us know what happens!
#9 lisa 0  05-OCT-88  8:37 Gerry Buck
 What a marvelous application.  Got any thoughts on how you would 
 implement something like this for a school district?  Possibilities 
 are fascinating and I agree with Meg, this would be better 'n 
 pen pals!!

 Luckily, both of the original classes on KIDLINK were equipped
 with phone lines, modems and an Apple computer.  The University
 provided the stimulus and support for obtaining the equipment.
 It is not altogether easy to convince school systems to fork over
 the $$ to do this.  The original project that the schools and
 UVA were involved in had to do with science and electronic mail.
 
 KIDLINK was an extension of that project (initiated after the
 equipment was in place).  The hearing impaired classes have already
 got computers and modems too.  It has been harder to actually
 get them on-line though.  An encouraging sign is that now that 
 the use of telecommunications in the classroom has been tried
 by a few, there seems to be a lot more interest in this by other
 teachers and school systems in our area.

 In response to the question about how to organize something
 like KIDLINK on a larger scale, i.e. for a whole school system --
 I am not exactly sure, but my guess is that the process is not
 going to be that much different than how you would organize/
 implement this in any other setting.  I will offer my (somewhat
 naive) point of view (as a teacher, until recently) on some
 considerations for implementing this type of thing in a school
 system.  (The system I worked for was very conservative/behind
 the times when it came to technology.)
 
 The first consideration is *money*--that seems first and 
 foremost in the minds of most administrators--an outside 
 funding source, such as some sort of grant would be ideal.
 Second, is that initial training for teachers and *on-going*
 support needs to be provided (and budgeted for).  Third, 
 is that use(s) of electronic conferencing needs to be 
 integrated into the already existing curriculum--it
 should not be something "extra" (one more thing to do), but
 should be used as an additional tool for learning/teaching
 skills and/or subjects that are already part of the curriculum.

 Susan, can I have your permission to 'port' this to my kids PTA.  
 I think the concept could go over big with the Fairfax County set.  
 Also, are you willing to <consult> on the set up if they bite?
