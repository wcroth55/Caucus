 Michael and Kevin, if only it were that easy!
 
 I agree with you in principal and am certainly against most levels of
 government intervention in my life, but the fact is that without funding
 I'm not sure the arts could really survive IN OUR SOCIETY AS IT STANDS
 TODAY!
 
 Arts would be turned into that $100 cheesee gallery in the mall kind of
 places.
 
 If there was a total social shift we might be able to make what you want
 work but not today...

 Seth, you are right...<I>"without funding I'm not sure the arts
 could really survive IN OUR SOCIETY AS IT STANDS TODAY! "</I>,
 but should that funding come from the government?&nbsp; Does the fact
 that <I>funding for the arts using tax dollars has become an
 institution (an entitlement)</I> lull many of us into
 complacency
 regarding the need to increase efforts to seek private funding
 for the arts.<P>
 I'm picking on funding for the arts here, but my question
 really applies to all types of government funding.&nbsp; It seems to
 me that once funding begins, it is nearly impossible to to
 discontinue.

 Kevin, are there any "entitlements" that you accept with less doubts?

 Government funding for the arts is so low that it would not make a
 noticeable dent in the federal budget, or anyone's taxes, and I think if
 one takes a long view of culture and society and the importance of art in
 how we define ourselves, it's a terrible place to start cutting if you ask
 me.
 
 Who's going to pick up the slack?  Philanthropists already kick in.  Us
 regular people aren't going to remember to send artists money on our own.
 They'll send us solicitations in the mail and they'll end up in the bin
 with the K-Mart flyers.  It will be terrible.  Take it out of taxes.  I bet
 most of us don't mind.  Somebody take a survey.  I predict most people say
 it's worthwhile.  And most of them wouldn't chip on on their own.  You can
 say that means art doesn't deserve funding in that case but I disagree;
 it's just not convenient.

 Geez, I guess I'm coming across fairly negative toward the arts
 and that is not what I intended.&nbsp; Kathy, I am having a difficult
 time thinking of <B>any</B> <I>"entitlements"</I> which I feel
 comfortable supporting.&nbsp; My problem is with the concept of
 <B><I>entitlement</I></B>, but maybe its just a definitional
 problem.
 <P>
 I can't think of any examples of entitlements which have ever
 been withdrawn because an endeavor was able to establish itself
 as economically self-sustaining (generated enough income to
 support itself or secured private funding).&nbsp; Are we actually
 limiting the success of private fundraising for the arts
 because of the meager amount that the government subsidizes?&nbsp;
 Would people be more apt to assist in funding privately if they
 knew that without their funds the arts would go away?&nbsp; Right
 now, they know that their taxes support the arts and there is
 no threat that the arts may die away.&nbsp; Would the public be more
 apt to fund privately if no government subsidies existed?

 Kevin, I don't think you're coming down against the arts but I do see your
 model as rather Victorian.  I am interested in your response to Kathy's
 question about whether you have the same response to all entitlements that
 are currently funded by taxes.
 
 I also wonder about the inefficiencies in your model which are introduced
 when agencies are placed in competition against each other to win
 charitable donations by advertizing and sending out flyers.  I know that
 in many scenarios competition for funding produces vigour and high
 performance but I think that it can also be very damaging and wasteful.
 
 It is also a question of whether market forces and cheesy forces like who
 has the best flyer and the most hype should be the main determinants of
 which art gets protected.
 
 I have seen another worrying model for arts funding in England. The
 government recently introduced a National Lottery, like they have in
 France, the profits of which would go to funding the arts.  There has been
 huge controversy about the way the money has been spent so far and the
 power to decide how money should best be spent has been taken out of the
 hands of the arts agencies and has become a political issue.
 
 I think we have to very careful here.
