 Using Caucus: How do I put HTML into a response?
 <B>This item is about how to actually <FONT SIZE=+3>use</FONT>
 HTML in a Caucus
 discussion.</B>
 
 <P>
 Several of the previous items have had highlighted links in
 them that point to other pages, or fancy typographic stuff.&nbsp;  
 How did we do that?&nbsp;  By
 entering
 a response as HTML.
 
 <P>
 But how does one do that?
 <p/>
 <ul>
 <li>Write the HTML yourself.&nbsp; That's what this item is about.
 <li>Use the richtext editor.  More on that at the very end of this item.
 </ul>

 If I just type text into a response, Caucus will automatically highlight any URL's, and make them "blue" so you can click on them.
 
 Like CaucusCare's home page, which is at http://www.caucuscare.com.

 So what happens if I type in some fancy HTML code, say, to show me some great works of art?
 
 I'll try this in the next response.

 Boy, that's a mess.  All it did was display what I wrote, and make the URL's blue.
 
 I'll try it again.  I'll "cut" the text of my response above, and "paste" it into the response textbox.
 
 Only this time, I'll click on the bar that says "word-wrapped", and pull it down until it says "HTML".

 A much, <span style="font-weight: bold;">much</span>, simpler way of
 creating fancy formatting is to use the "richtext editor".&nbsp; Simply
 click on the "Use richtext editor" link, to the upper right of the
 response box.&nbsp; Suddenly you have a full-featured word processor at
 your command, which (underneath the hood, so to speak) simply spits out
 HTML.&nbsp; You don't need to know anything about HTML to use it, just
 point and click.
