 Introduction to Caucus: Conferences, Items, & Responses.
 <blockquote>
 When you begin using Caucus, it is important to keep in mind
 how Caucus is structured.&nbsp;  This item explains the terms:
 </blockquote>
 
 <P>
 <UL><TABLE>
    <TR><TD></TD>      <TD><B>conference</B></TD>
 
    <TR><TD></TD>      <TD><B>item</B></TD>
 
    <TR><TD><i>and</i> </TD>  <TD><B>response</B></TD>
 </TABLE></UL>
 <P>
 <blockquote>
 
 In the basic structure of Caucus, group discussions take
 place inside what are known as "conferences".&nbsp;    A
 single Caucus host computer -- typically a Web server on an
 Intranet or
 at an Internet Web site -- will usually be the home for many
 different
 conferences.
 <P>
 
 Conferences can either be "open" to anyone having access to the
 Caucus host Web site, or "private" (reserved for exclusive
 use by a particular group).
 
 <P>
 A computer conference consists of many separate discussions,
 called <B>items</B>.&nbsp;    Each item has two parts: the item text,
 and the responses to it.
 
 <P>
 <UL>
 <LI>
 The item <B>text</B> is what someone enters to begin a new
 Caucus discussion.
 
 <P>
 <LI>
 The <B>responses</B>, which are appended to an item, consist of
 the comments (or questions) added by other persons in response
 to the item.
 </UL>
 
 <P>
 Here is a diagram of this basic structure of a Caucus
 conference.

 (More responses are added to items over time, and new items can
 also be started.)
 
 <P>
 What you are reading right now is the text for <B>Item 2</B>
 in this conference.&nbsp;
 When you look at an item, Caucus first shows you the text of
 that item, followed by the responses.&nbsp;    Once you've seen the
 responses, you will have the chance to add your own response.

 <blockquote>
 What you are reading right now is a <B>response</B> -- and
 you'll notice that it starts with a line that shows
 
 <UL>
 <LI> its number (in this case, <B>2:1</B>
 since this is the first response to item number 2),
 <P>
 <LI>
 then the date and time the response was entered,
 <P>
 <LI>
 and then the name of the author (which is automatically added).&nbsp;
 The name is a link, which you can click on to learn more about
 the person.
 <P>
 
 </UL>
 
 <P>
 Next comes the <b>text</b> of the response; that is what you
 are reading right now.&nbsp;   It can contain ordinary text, or a
 mixture of text and <B>HTML</B>.&nbsp;   We'll learn more about
 putting graphics and other HTML data into a response a
 little later in this demonstration conference.
