 If it's a hoax, it's at least a good one.  I don't know more about this
 petition than the origin of the version I got.

 I'm all for funding the NPR.&nbsp;  I'm just against federal funding
 of the NPR.&nbsp;  Rather than signing a petition suggesting that
 legislators <B><I>take my money</I></B> and give it to the NPR,
 sign a check and mail it to the NPR.&nbsp;  Eliminate the middle man.

 Michael, I might agree with you if I hadn't been watching what the withdrawal
 of government support for the arts has done.  The government presence gave
 legitimacy to the arts in general, and helped attract support to the
 organizations it funded.  As the government role has declined, there's been
 a shift in attitude, and the private support has not filled the gaps.  The
 presence may be a token one, but I would not want to see it diminish
 completely.

 Michael, federal funds have provided significant seed money for the arts
 That's not trivial at all since seed money is the hardest to identify and
 secure.
#0006 megreen 0 04-FEB-96 21:55 Michael Green
 Kathy,  continued funding for the NPR is not 'seed' money.
 Seed money by definition is money that is used to begin a
 project/adventure/business.  The NPR is up and running.  Seed
 money is no longer needed.  Now it should be left to it's own
 devices and listeners.
 
 Lee, you've touched on a more phylisophical issue.  One which is
 more fundamental to my point.  The only function government
 funding serves the arts, as I see it, is to allow that which is
 no longer a part of our culture to continue to survive.  I
 prefer a more darwinistic approach to the issue.  If people
 want this type of art, then it will survive.  If not, it will
 go away.  You wouldn't suggest that federal funding be used to
 preserve Disco, would you?.  I was very pleased recently,
 during the govt shutdown, when private funding was used to
 reopen part of a museum in Washington to make a certain display
 available.
 
 To clearly state my point...
 The issue is culture.  Culture is that which we do in our free
 time.  If we no longer find oil paintings or orchestras
 interesting, than they will no longer be a part of our culture.
 Keeping them alive after their time is past, serves no
 purpose.  I'm all for museums.  I enjoy classical music.  I
 like to have paintings on my wall.  For each of these
 pleasures, I will pay.  I won't send you the bill.  Please
 don't send me your bills either.

 Unless you are a major underwriter, I doubt that you are sustaining the
 classical music organizations you go to hear.  To just say "If I want it
 I will pay for it" implies more economic power than I have.  One way I
 can pool my resources through others is through taxes and public funding
 for things I value.
#0008 madden 0 04-FEB-96 23:06 Kathy Madden (madden)
 Michael, you've very "clearly stated your point" about "culture" and
 it made me smile.  Surely, you're not implying that "culture" is
 restricted to art, music, theater, architecture, etc.  Many of us think of
 culture as the essence of *who* and *what* we are...the stuff we
 leave behind as "history"...if that "who" is restricted to a discrete
 group of "experts" and that "what" doesn't include the expressions
 of people with diverse perspectives, talents, and abilities, our society
 is in a helluvalotta trouble.

 The culture of the American workplace is also a kind of culture, and one
 that I would like to see revitalized.  To say the culture is only something
 we do in our free time is silly.  Businesses have paintings on the wall,
 honor a person's creativity and passions, or not, have open and closed
 cultures, regenerating and degenerating [entropic] cultures, allow free
 expression or not, and of course all of these to varying degrees and shades
 of gray or blue or magenta.
 
 Abraham Maslow said once that the true measure of the health of a culture
 is it's willingness to support entrepreneurial [and perhaps he meant also
 creative] behavior.  Since  culture defined broadly includes what you say
 happens in one's free time, art and expression, organization cultures,
 political cultures, and the entirety of free or constrained expression.
 I'm in favor of our government, and our taxes, supporting and encouraging
 and training and funding the ability of citizens to think and be creative.
 And the constraint of that in the current climate, whether limiting
 budgets or hampering free speech on the internet, is a stricture on the
 health and vitality of the country, not just the individual artists or
 agencies involved.
 
 To follow the argument above that if people value art they will pay for
 it...sounds like you only want affluent people to have art.  I know few
 people in Anacostia who can afford to buy a piece of art, but I think they
 are just as entitled to enjoy it.  Businesses, of course, can decide
 exactly what products it produces and for whom, and has no obligation to
 serve everyone, unless they choose to.  Government, ideally serving all, is
 a vehicle that for some things may be the correct vehicle to make
 something universally available, such as the Government Printing Office, or
 the U.S. Post Office, and the special art collections at the Smithsonian,
 though isn't that a quasi-government agency, and of course funded by a
 disgruntled Englishman.

 Lee, there probably aren't too many of us out here who could
 individually underwrite the arts.&nbsp; The notion of pooling
 resources to support the arts is necessary for it to continue,
 but could this be accomplished privately?&nbsp; When taxes are used
 to fund something that I would not choose to support
 individually and voluntarily, does it then become governmental
 extortion?
 <P>
 Kathy, you've picked up on a subtlety in Michael's comments
 regarding the use of the term <B><I>culture</I></B>.&nbsp; I
 interpreted his comments regarding <B><I>culture</I></B> in the
 context of his response to refer to artistic creativity and
 expression (art, music, theater, architecture, etc. as you
 suggested).&nbsp; But I must agree with your view of culture as "the
 essence of <B><I>who</I></B> and <B><I>what</I></B> we are."&nbsp;
 Should our taxes be used to preserve "the stuff we leave behind
 as <B><I>history</I></B>"?
 <P>
 What could we do to ensure that the arts and everything about
 our diverse culture(s) are preserved if government funding
 where withdrawn?&nbsp; (I realize that the question may be viewed as
 academic since I for one have little faith in our ability to
 reduce government entitlements.)&nbsp; I guess what I am asking is to
 suppose that tomorrow the government subsidy for the arts
 stopped flowing.&nbsp; What would you do to protect and preserve our
 culture?
#0011 madden 0 05-FEB-96  8:17 Kathy Madden (madden)

 Kevin, we had an example of what happens to "preservation and protection"
 during the recent furloughs.  The Smithsonian was closed.  Who lost and who
 won?

 Kevin noted a fundamental phenomenon at work in the middle of this
 discussion, and that is that there is no generally accepted "rule" about
 what the government should fund.  What has value, and who decides that?
 Many think performing arts and visual arts should be funded.  Many don't.
 Should we be allowed to decided that individually?  How would we document
 that?  I might want to specify my taxes not go to certain NIH experiments
 on animals, or to tobacco subsidies.  Others would want to withhold their
 taxes from the arts.  It opens a can of worms, getting people to think of
 themselves as taxpayers with a checklist.  I guess the current answer is
 lobbying your elected official who votes, presumably, for you.  Until we
 have a better answer, tell those people what you think.  For now, the
 pressure of public opinion will decide this.

 Kathy, no one believed that the government furloughs were
 permanent, so a temporary closure of The Smithsonian was
 expected to be just that - temporary.  However, during that same
 time period, I believe I heard that there was at least one
 museum which received private funding to remain open.  Perhaps
 that is an example of what would happen if government funding
 were withdrawn.
 
 I'm not sure I can identify a winner in the government furlough
 fiasco.  There were many losers.  Clearly, the taxpayer lost in a
 big way since in the end, she/he paid for services that our
 government did not deliver.  The cynic in me doesn't view it as
 a total loss though.  I must admit that there was some element
 of entertainment and education value in watching the abuse of
 power which was displayed.

 Andrean, I could not agree with you more.  You have just
 described to me how our democratic process should (and does)
 work.  I do what I can to ensure that I am well represented in
 our government.  I hope that others do the same.  If I want the
 taxpayer checklist, then I better get busy finding someone who
 can represent me in government to achieve that.  If I want more
 (or less) government subsidies, then hopefully I can elect
 someone who can represent my beliefs.

 Sherrie,  I agree with you that Culture is much more than 'what
 we do in our free time'.&nbsp;  I used that to put the subject in a
 better light.&nbsp;  Yes, culture is all those things, but I feel it
 was easier to take the <i>short</i> road in this case.&nbsp;  For the
 record,
 I'm one of the few people I know that works in my free time.&nbsp;
 By this I mean that I during those 8-10 hours most people are
 working, I am doing exactly what I would want to be doing -
 working.
 <P>
 
 I consider myself to be a trader.&nbsp;  I believe in the exchange
 of value for value.&nbsp;  If I were an artist, (and I am, you should
 see my computer networks sometime), I wouldn't find any value
 in the government 'giving' me money in the interest of
 'culture'.&nbsp;  If I can't find buyers for my works, then they must
 not be any good.&nbsp;  My art, my expression is in the form of
 network administration.&nbsp;  I make companies more productive and
 profitable.&nbsp;  My reward is a check.&nbsp;  If my 'art' is bad 'art', I
 don't get paid.&nbsp;  The same should be true for all aspects of
 'culture'
 <P>
 As you've pointed out there is no difference in my contribution
 to 'culture' than any musician.

 In respect of this debate I find it fascinating that last week a French
 national opinion poll asked the question 'Should the state provide support
 for the arts?' 84% said yes, 12% said no.  The next question asked whether
 the current level of french state support for the arts was too high, about
 right, or too low (france already has the highest rate of state support for
 the arts at about US$550 per head).  46% said it's about right, 28% that it
 was too low, the remainder thinking it was too high.  In commenting on the
 results the French minister of Culture observed 'When the body politic
 stops supporting the arts, then that society is on the road to collapse in
 all its facets.'
 
 What a diverse world!

 Apparently, Berliners spend 7 times as much on the arts as the U.S. which
 has a population 75 times larger.

 The city of Berlin's subsidy to opera alone is bigger than the 1995
 budget ($162M) for the National Endowment for the Arts -- which was
 halved this year to $99.5M.
