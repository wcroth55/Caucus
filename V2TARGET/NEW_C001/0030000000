 Hi!  This is a sample "describe yourself" response.
 
 I'm the founder of %url(http://caucuscare.com CaucusCare).  Aside from my interests in the World Wide Web and Caucus, I'm an avid contra- and english-country %url(http://www.aactmad.org dancer), and a fan of %url(http://www.umich.edu/~umgass Gilbert and Sullivan) and other community theatre.
