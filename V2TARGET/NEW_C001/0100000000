 Designing your Caucus Conference Center

    Here's another "how to" item, this one taken from the
    <A HREF="http://www.tmn.com" TARGET="_blank">Meta Network</A> again.
 
    <P>
    This item introduces some ideas about how to structure
    your overall Caucus site, or set of conferences.

 One of the first things you'll want to do is sketch out the
 initial design for your Conference Center.
 
 <P>
 It's helpful to think in terms of three types of conferences:
 
 <P>
 <OL>
    <LI><B>A "central" conference.</B>
 
        <P>
        You'll need one conference where EVERYONE
        checks in regularly for bulletins, general information,
        and pointers to happenings in other conferences.&nbsp;    Some
        Conference organizers configure their system so that all
 users
        arrive in the central conference automatically.
 
        <P>
        The NAME of this central conference will help convey its
        purpose - and can contribute to establishing the
        Conference Center's atmosphere.&nbsp;    Examples of central
 conference names
        include; News, Salon, Lounge, Portal, and Town_Square.
 
        <P>
    <LI>  <B>Open Conferences.</B>
 
        <P>
        You will probably want to start other conferences which
        are open to everyone with access to your Conference
 Center.&nbsp;   It is
        usually a good idea to limit the number of these for a
        while at first, so your members
        don't get overwhelmed and lost.
 
        <P>
        Some typical purposes for open conferences are: providing
        user support, publishing a newsletter, open planning
        processes, and tracking special events.
 
 
        <P>
    <LI> <B> Private Conferences.</B>
 
        <P>
        One of the best applications of a Conference Center is
 to support
        teams, task forces, committees, work groups, boards, and
        any other defined groups who share a common purpose or
 are working on a project together.&nbsp;
 Most
        of these will need their own PRIVATE conference in which
        to work.
 
        <P>
        You'll want to set up some process for groups who want to
        establish a private conference and help them select a
 good
        name, choose an organizer, and get their members started.
 </OL>
 <P>
 Have you selected the name for your Conference Center yet?&nbsp;
 Mapping
 out the design of the conferences can help you think about the
 character of your center and what you want to convey through
 its
 name.

 It can be helpful to provide your network members with a "map"
 to show the layout of the different conferences.
 <P>
 You could put the MAP on the "welcome" page, or put a link to
 it there... or even put it as a button or a link at the bottom
 of every page.
 <P>
 Here's an example of how it might look:

 You can use responses to this item to brainstorm about names for
 your conferences.
 
 What would be a good name for your central conference?  What
 kinds of metaphors work for your members?  What words convey the
 feeling you want your Conference Center to communicate?
