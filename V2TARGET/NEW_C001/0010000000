 Introduction to this Demonstration conference.
 <blockquote>
 You are now viewing the first item in the Caucus demonstration
 computer conference.&nbsp;  Think of this conference as a sampler.&nbsp;
 It contains:
 
 <UL>
 <LI>a brief description of Caucus, and how to use it,
 <P>
 
 <LI>excerpts of real-life discussions from
 Caucus conferences at a variety of organizations,<P>
 
 <LI>examples of how you can add interaction and discussion to
     your existing Web sites, and<P>
 
 <LI>illustrations of some important Caucus features.
 </UL>
 
 <P>
 This conference is designed to make it easy for you to

 <B><FONT SIZE=+3>F</FONT>or starters</B>,
  just what is "<B>Conferencing</B>?"
 <P>
 Organizations thrive on information.&nbsp;   The group and team
 projects that determine organizational success work best
 when people can easily exchange information -- and create
 new information in that exchange.
 <P>
 Caucus conferencing provides a "virtual space" where people
 can do just that -- easily share information and create new
 information.&nbsp;   We call this virtual space a Conference Center.&nbsp;
 A conference
 is an online discussion among a group of people about some
 topic, process, or project.
 <P>
 A conference may be devoted to
 
 <UL>
 <LI>policy discussions and decision-making,
 <LI>managing a project, department or team,
 <LI>providing technical support,
 <LI>building community through feedback,
 <LI>distance education,
 </UL>
 
 among other purposes.&nbsp;   The participants in such a conference
 may be
 <UL>
 
 <LI>an executive committee,
 <LI>a project team,
 <LI>the employees of one department of an enterprise or all
 <LI>its employees,
 <LI>the citizens of a community.
 </UL>
 
 Caucus allows conference participants to attend the
 conference "meetings" at their own
 convenience.&nbsp;   So, a conference can supplement or
 replace traditional meetings.&nbsp;   Conference members can be
 scattered across a building or around the world.
 <P>
 
 Caucus allows conference participants to enter not only text,
 but also graphics,
 HTML links to files and  other information, audio, video --
 any information compatible with the Web.
  <P>
 
 The computer on which Caucus is running keeps a
 complete record of everything that takes place in the
 conference.&nbsp;   It also keeps a personal record of what
 you've seen, and what you're interested in.
 <P>
 
 Organizations large and small are using Caucus
 conferencing to help meet their need to share information
 easily and effectively.&nbsp;   In the rest of this conference, you'll
 learn more about how your organization can use Caucus
 and also see samples of discussion
 items from a variety of different "real world" Caucus
 applications.
