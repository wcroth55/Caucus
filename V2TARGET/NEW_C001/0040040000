 Thanks Lisa.  This is topic drift -- I can't remember where this was requested, so I"m posting it with a giant mea culpa

 are now searchable.  Thanks to Kevin Hughes for the programs and
 the help in setting them up.

 Does anyone have any experience or information about the "Expires:" line in the MIME headers that are passed to Web browsers?
 
 I'm trying to use it ("Expires:") in dynamic HTML.  Results so far:
 
     lynx   -- always ignores "Expires:" and once a page has been
               fetched, keeps re-using the same page
 
     mosaic -- always refetches a page, whether or not it has
               expired.

 Hmm, "Expires:" sounds like RFC1036 newsgroup header, were you looking at news?

 I thought it had to do with the bookmark function and wehther or not the link is purple to indicate that you've been there before.  But, I may be wrong.

 That's a Netscape specific thing (the purple links).

 Okay, but isn't there an EXPIRES tag in the bookmark followed by a date that lets you know when you've been so place before.  I know that on EMOSAIC it turns  the links Red.

 "Expires" is part of the MIME standard header that must preceed HTML sent by the server.  It is described in "Spinning the Web", pages 148-150, it just doesn' t seem to work as suggested.

 Thanks for reference.  Now, here's a stupid question -- Can you explain
 in non-technical language what MIME is and why anyone who is creating
 HTML pages would have to know about it?

 Alas, I forget what MIME stands for.  But it is a set of extensions
 to e-mail standards that allow for the transmission of data files
 (graphics, sound, word proc. documents, etc.) as part of e-mail.
 
 I know that 'elm', for example, can handle many of the MIME extensions.
 Not sure about other mailers.
 
 Well, when HTML was developed, they used the MIME headers to simply
 define a new type of file called, not surprisingly, HTML.  Which
 means that you can also ship HTML files around by mail, if your
 mailer is MIME-enabled.
 
 If you are writing static HTML pages, you can pretty much ignore
 MIME.  BUT!  If you ever tinker with dynamic HTML (that is,
 HTML pages that are created on-the-fly by CGI programs), you MUST
 know about MIME headers.  When a Web server sends HTML to a
 Web browser, the HTML is always preceeded (surprise!) by a
 MIME header.

 The newest release of Netscape (1.1b) is now a MIME compliant mail and
 newsreader (at least according to the readme) so that if you are
 reading a newsgroup with MIME encoded attachments it will pull out the
 attachments and decode them for you (at least GIFs and JPEGs) so you
 can view them.  Currently however most newsgroups use uuencode which
 isn't supported by MIME, you have to use Base64 encoding which is
 provided my most mail programs, susch as pine or eudora.
 
 By the way, I think MIME stands for Multimedia Internet Mail Extensions.
