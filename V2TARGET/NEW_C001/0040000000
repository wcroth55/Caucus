    Here is the first "sample" discussion from a real Caucus
 conference in the early days of the Web,
    called <B>WWWCOOP</B>.
    <P>
    The WWWCOOP conference is a knowledge "cooperative" at the
    <A HREF="http://www.tmn.com" TARGET="_blank">MetaNet</A>, where people share
    their knowledge about the World Wide Web, including (as
    you'll see below) "howto"
    information about HTML and browsers.

 <P>
 I had an interesting experience in posting my home page.&nbsp;    It
 seems to look
 differently on Air Mosaic, Netscape, and Prodigy.&nbsp;    Am I correct
 in
 thinking that different browsers read HTML language slightly
 differently.&nbsp;
 My text looks different from one browser to another.&nbsp;    Anybody
 have any
 insights as to how this might happen.
