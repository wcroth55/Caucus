    Returning to sample items from other conferences, you may
    not be surprised to learn that
    <B>on-line debate</B> is something that can
    and will happen in a conference.
 
    <P>
    But in practice, the more the conference is structured
    as a <B>community</B>, the more respectful people are of each other.
 
    <P>
    And many of the features of Caucus, including the
    organization
    into individually controlled conferences, and the automatic
    posting of author links
    by each response, are meant to promote and remind us of the
    idea that we are all talking with real people.

 <P>
 A couple of days ago, I got an email message forwarding a
 petition in
 support of funding for National Public Radio.&nbsp;    You were
 supposed to sign
 it and forward it to others.&nbsp;    People who were 50th, 100th, etc
 were
 supposed to send them to a central collection site.
 
 <P>I sent it
 along, got
 it from some other sources, and got to chatting with a friend
 about how
 these things are tallied and how they work.
 <P>
 So she sent email to the addresses contained in the petition as
 the
 places people whose names were 50th, 100th, etc should send it
 to, asking
 how they kept it all straight and if there wasn't a danger that
 they
 could miss some signatories.
 <P>
 All of her messages were returned, users unknown.
 
 
 Anyone know anything about this?  Is it all a hoax?
