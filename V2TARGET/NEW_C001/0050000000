    <B>Customer support</B> is another good application
    for Caucus conferencing.
 
    <P>
    In this item, we see a Caucus item being used to notify,
    handle, and record support calls for a particular Caucus
    customer.&nbsp;  
    In this case, the conference was "private", and could only
    be read by the tech support staff.
 
    <P>
    An "open" conference, that your customers can join, can also
    be helpful in managing customer support.

 Bill called in with a problem after installing Caucus: no-one but root
 could use Caucus.  I dialed in through a temporary hook-up (he doesn't
 have a regular dial-in number yet) and looked around.  Discovered that
 the command "chmod 4711 caucus_x" doesn't work!
 
 More precisely, it says "Warning: cannot change caucus_x".  After talking
 with Bill, discovered that they have installed "C2" class security on
 their system.  This is probably the cause, as further experimentation
 showed that I could chmod to any permission that did not include the
 set-uid-bit.
 
 Anyway, I had Bill chmod caucus_x and cauchk_x from root, and he's
 happy now.

 Sounds like a request-for-doc-change to me.  Where do I make that request?

 In the left-brain conference, the "doc" item.
#0004 roth 0 05-MAR-92 16:45 Charles Roth (roth)
 Bill Wetmore now needs (and was just sent) 3.5 inch disks.
#0005 richens 0 08-JUN-92 11:14 Michele L. Richens (richens)
 Wetmore called Friday said he is just getting around to installing old 5
 1/4" kit.  Claims he never received 3.5" kit but has since bought a new
 drive.  Said disk three was coming up unreadable.  Sent a new kit today.  His
 support had expired, but since he hasn't used Caucus, we still sent the
 updated version.  Also sent support renewal request.

 Problem:
 Had never installed Caucus - equipment and other bothers.
 Tried to this morning, but had upgraded Xenix so we relicensed Caucus.
 Aren't we swell?
 
 Then, he moved some stuff and did some things and couldn't get
 Caucus to work again.  Aaron talked him through it and now things 
 are peachy.  PS. he asked for a support invoice so I faxed and mailed 
 one today.  This is not OPEN!

 Well, Wetmore called back.  Problems with Can't open unitview.
 Turned out to be an ownership problem.  Fixed that.
 He'd like a call from Aaron about entryfiles.  Thank you.

 Called again.  Wants to set up his own set of file libraries for access
 through Caucus.  Can we help him?  Also asked about linking to Foxbase.  I
 said I'd check, but the only way I know is by escaping to shell.  He seemed
 thrilled that he could use !commands from Caucus.
#0009 jvictor 0 28-DEC-92 10:35 Jeff Victor (jvictor)
 "Can" we help him?  Sure.  We'll answer all sorts of questions, within
 reason.  If he wants us to do any dictionary modifications, that costs
 money.

 Bill Wetmore called.  He upgraded his SCO license, and his license
 number changed.  I went through relicensing it, and he's OK now.
 
 He is interested in not having the copyright notice appear.  I told
 him he would have to talk to Michele for approval on that, that we've
 been burned before.
 
 Personally I think he's an OK & positive guy and we should approve his
 request.
