 Sample Apps: Using Caucus for group document review
 <b><i>Caucus</b></i> is a key groupware solution for the Web.&nbsp;   It meets a
 core business need by providing Web-based discussion centers where groups
 of all sizes can easily exchange information.
 <p> Because <b><i>Caucus</b></i> discussions can include rich text
 formatting, live
 links, file libraries,
 images, A/V clips, and other Web information, they quickly become a focal
 point for effective teamwork.
 <p>
 <b><i>Caucus</b></i> is easy to use for collaborative applications.&nbsp;  
 Here's an example of a document being reviewed by a workgroup.

 Gang -- in the response following this one, I've placed the summary of
 conferencing and its applications, written by Joe.
 <p>
 Marked in <font color=red>Red</font> are the
 passages I think are key; please comment on these, or give me an improved
 version if you like.
 <p>
 I've put in a couple of comments in <font color=green>Green</font>,
 asking for specific feedback.
 <p>
 Because of our schedule,I'm going to freeze this item on friday, so now
 is your chance!

 <center><font size=+2>Summary Document: What is Caucus
 Conferencing</font></center><p>
 <b></b><i></i><p>
 <i></i><p>
 Organizations thrive on information.&nbsp;   The group and team projects that
 determine
 organizational success work best when people can easily exchange
 information.
 <p>
 <p>
 <b><i>Caucus</i></b> discussion conferences provide a "virtual space"
 where
 people can do just that - easily share information and create new
 information.&nbsp;  
 We call such a virtual space a Conference Center. <p>
 <p>
 <font color=red>A conference is an online discussion among a group of
 people about some
 project, issue, or process.&nbsp;   In such a discussion, participants present and
 share information, and they collaborate to create new information.&nbsp;</font>
 The
 conference does not occur in "real time;" instead, participants
 contribute to
 "meetings" on conference topics whenever they visit their Web site's
 Conference
 Center.<p>
 <p>
 A conference may be used for: <p>
 <font color=green>(Let me know whether you think this is a helpful
 list)</font><p>
 ·	policy discussions and decision-making, <br>
 ·	managing a project, department or team, <br>
 ·	providing technical support, <br>
 ·	building community through feedback, <br>
 ·	distance education,
 <p>
 among many applications.&nbsp;   The participants in such a conference may be:<p>
 <p>
 ·	an executive committee, <br>
 ·	a project team, <br>
 ·	the employees of one department of an enterprise <br>
 ·	all enterprise employees, <br>
 ·	the citizens of a community,
 <p>
 or any other group. <p>
 <p>
 Because <b><i>Caucus</i></b> allows conference participants to attend
 conference "meetings" at their own convenience, a conference can
 supplement or
 replace traditional meetings.&nbsp;   Conference members can be scattered across a
 building or around the world. <p>
 <p>
 A <b><i>Caucus</i></b> conference center can host what for all practical
 purposes is an unlimited number of conferences, providing secure
 inclusion in,
 or exclusion from, a given conference for the many individuals and groups
 using
 the center.&nbsp;   Each conference will typically be devoted to a particular
 application, such as:<p>
 <p>
 ·	locating an appropriate new home for our international
 headquarters, <br>
 ·	managing a sales team, <br>
 ·	coordinating a just-in-time inventory system between your company
 and
 mine, <br>
 ·	seeking agreement on a new health plan provider<br>
 ·	discussing issues regarding zoning laws in our community, <br>
 ·	editing and reviewing graphic design of our new marketing
 brochure,
 <p>
 and so forth.&nbsp;   <font color=green>
 <p>(Please suggest additional examples,
 John)</font>
 <p>
 <b><i>Caucus</i></b> allows conference participants to enter not only
 text, but
 also graphics, HTML links to files of information, audio, video - any
 information compatible with the Web.&nbsp;   Conference participants, in other
 words,
 are able to show and make use of a wide variety of informational,
 documentary,
 analytical and illustrative materials.<p>
 <p>
 <b><i>Caucus</i></b> keeps a complete record of everything that takes
 place in
 the conference.&nbsp;   It also keeps a personal record of what you have seen,
 and what
 you are interested in following closely.<p>

 <p>
 Re: <i>"We need a concluding paragraph for this document..."</i>
 <p>
 <blockquote>
 Somewhere i would make reference to email vs conferencing.
 <p>
 Note that
 email comes chronologically and interlaced with other mail.&nbsp;   Even filters
 or groupware that puts it in folders requires you to go into each and
 read.
 <p>
 Maybe a paragraph could include some of these thoughts:
 <P>
 Conferencing allows you to set your own schedule.&nbsp;   When you "are in the
 mood" to work on a particular project you can move to that conference
 area and everything is there, organized for your ease of use.&nbsp;   Or, you
 might have some conference areas that are the type you must keep up with.
 Those could be reviewed more frequently.&nbsp;   Not only does conferencing supply
 the organization to help you work more effectively and with less stress,
 it keeps a running transcript of everything that occurred (and date
 stamped!).&nbsp; You can therefore reconstruct events and review past actions
 to learn how to better perform in the future.
