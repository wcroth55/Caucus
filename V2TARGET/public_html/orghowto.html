<b>1.	Introduction</b><p>
<p>
This "How To" guide describes the details of <b>how</b> a Caucus conference
organizer administers a conference.&nbsp; For more general information about the
<b>whys</b> of conference management, see the companion 
<A HREF="organize.html">Guide for Conference Organizers</A>.

<p>
When the Caucus manager creates a conference, he or she also assigns
someone to be the primary organizer -- the person in charge of the conference.
Caucus gives this person special abilities.<p>
<p>
The primary organizer may in turn give other people these special abilities in
order to share the power and responsibility of managing the conference.  <p>

<p>
<b>2.	Starting a Conference</b><p>
<p>
Conferences must be created by a Caucus manager, from the manager options
page.&nbsp;
The manager creates an empty conference with no items,
a primary organizer, and an optional list of other organizers.
<P>
The manager may also chose to make the conference "closed" (no-one else
may join until the organizer(s) decide what to do) or "open" (anyone may join,
immediately).

<p>
Conference names may be up to 80 characters long,
and may contain letters, numbers, blanks, underscores, dashes, or dots.&nbsp;
(Underscores are treated as blanks).

<p>
A new conference has a
default INTRODUCTION and GREETING.&nbsp;  (These terms are defined below.)  The
organizer should join the new conference as soon as is convenient to prepare
the conference for its participants.<p>

<p>
<b>3.	Customizing a Conference</b><p>
<p>
Caucus gives organizers of a conference special abilities to assist with
setting up and maintaining a conference.&nbsp; Many of these abilities, such as
controlling who can join a conference, are provided by the <b>customize</b>
link in the conference home page.&nbsp;
Only organizers can use this link.<p>
<p>

Pressing the customize link brings up a page with links for
customizing:
<P>
<UL>
<LI><B>Users</B> -- who they are and what they can do
<P>
<LI><B>Conference Information</B> -- information about the
conference for others to see (such as the one-line conference
description and the introduction for new would-be members).
<P>
<LI><B>Colors</B> -- for controlling the colors of pages and
parts of pages for this conference
<P>
<LI><B>Home Page Options</B> -- to control precisely what appears
on the conference home page.
<P>
<LI><B>E-mail Notification</B> -- control the e-mail notification feature
</UL>

<P>&nbsp;<P>
<B>4. Customize users</B>
<P>
While each page is provided with on-line help and instructions,
the <B>Users</B> page is important enough to warrant additional
description.&nbsp;
This is especially true since it's the first thing that new
conference organizers will have to work with.

<P>
<B>Note:</B>&nbsp;
it may be helpful to print out this page, and then keep it
in hand while working with the customize pages in Caucus.

<P>
The first two parts of the <B>Users</B> page control
<B>Conference Membership</B> and <B>User Capabilities</B>
-- in other words, who can join the conference, and what they can
do while they're there.)

<A NAME="cususers"><P></A>
<B>4.1 Conference Membership</B> <BR>
This section contains four (or more)
text boxes with a pull-down menu at the top of each box.&nbsp;
Use the pull-down menus to select which kind of membership access
people should have: 
<P>
<UL>
<LI>organizer (can do anything, including control membership and edit
    any item or response)
<LI>include (regular membership)
<LI>readonly (may view but can not add their own responses)
<LI>exclude (no access).
</UL>
<P>
Then, in the matching text box, type in the userids of the people.

<P>
<FORM>
For example, in the membership section shown below, jsmith and bjones
are included as regular members, and mrobin is an organizer.

<TABLE>
<TR><TD>&nbsp;&nbsp;</TD>
<TD><SELECT><OPTION>include</SELECT><BR>
    <TEXTAREA ROWS=5 COLS=9>jsmith
bjones</TEXTAREA>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD><SELECT><OPTION>organizer</SELECT><BR>
    <TEXTAREA ROWS=5 COLS=9>mrobin</TEXTAREA></TD>
<TD><SELECT><OPTION>(not used)</SELECT><BR>
    <TEXTAREA ROWS=5 COLS=9></TEXTAREA></TD>
<TD><SELECT><OPTION>(not used)</SELECT><BR>
    <TEXTAREA ROWS=5 COLS=9></TEXTAREA></TD>
</TABLE>

<P>
Entries in the text boxes may be specific userids, as shown above,
or may combine text and a trailing "wild card" (an asterisk).&nbsp;
For example an entry "csc*" means "all userids that begin with the 
letters 'csc'".&nbsp;
An entry of just "*" means all userids.
<P>
Thus, reading left to right in the membership section below, 
everyone is included,
<B>but</B> all userids beginning with "csc" get read-only permission,
<B>except</B> for user "csc001" who is explicitly excluded from the conference
altogether.&nbsp;
Userid mrobin is an organizer.

<TABLE>
<TR><TD>&nbsp;&nbsp;</TD>
<TD><SELECT><OPTION>include</SELECT><BR>
    <TEXTAREA ROWS=5 COLS=9>*</TEXTAREA>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD><SELECT><OPTION>readonly</SELECT><BR>
    <TEXTAREA ROWS=5 COLS=9>csc*</TEXTAREA></TD>
<TD><SELECT><OPTION>exclude</SELECT><BR>
    <TEXTAREA ROWS=5 COLS=9>csc001</TEXTAREA></TD>
<TD><SELECT><OPTION>organizer</SELECT><BR>
    <TEXTAREA ROWS=5 COLS=9>mrobin</TEXTAREA></TD>
</TABLE>

<P>
There's one more case to consider.&nbsp;
Entries in the text boxes may also be references to "groups".&nbsp;
A group is a collection of people (i.e., of userids) that has been
created by a Caucus manager.
<P>
For example, if you had a group of staff people that were expected to
participate in several conferences, the Caucus manager might use the
Caucus manager menu to create a group called "staff", and in it place
the userids of the staff members.&nbsp;
Conference organizers could then reference the group, as shown below:

<TABLE>
<TR><TD>&nbsp;&nbsp;</TD>
<TD><SELECT><OPTION>include</SELECT><BR>
    <TEXTAREA ROWS=5 COLS=9><staff</TEXTAREA>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD><SELECT><OPTION>organizer</SELECT><BR>
    <TEXTAREA ROWS=5 COLS=9>mrobin
jsmith</TEXTAREA></TD>
<TD><SELECT><OPTION>(not used)</SELECT><BR>
    <TEXTAREA ROWS=5 COLS=9></TEXTAREA></TD>
<TD><SELECT><OPTION>(not used)</SELECT><BR>
    <TEXTAREA ROWS=5 COLS=9></TEXTAREA></TD>
</TABLE>

which includes everyone in the staff group, and makes mrobin and
jsmith organizers.&nbsp;
(The "&lt;" in front of "staff" means that staff is a group rather
than a single userid.)&nbsp;
<P>
Note that there is a link right above the text boxes called
<U><FONT COLOR=BLUE>User Groups on this system</FONT></U>
that displays the groups that are available on this host.&nbsp;
This may be helpful when setting up the membership in your
conference.

<P>
<B>Warning</B>: the left-to-right order is important.&nbsp;
Boxes to the right potentially override boxes to the left.&nbsp;
Thus "include *" followed by "organizer jsmith" includes everyone
but makes jsmith an organizer; whereas "organizer jsmith" followed by
"include *" makes jsmith just an ordinary user!
<P>
Or in other words, when in doubt, list your organizers last.

</FORM>

<P>&nbsp;<P>
<B>4.2 User Capabilities</B><BR>
This section provides finer-grained control over what users
can do in your conference.

<P>
<UL>
<LI><B>Allow users to edit their responses?</B><BR>
Use this pull-down menu to control when users may edit the text 
of responses they wrote.&nbsp;
Normally users may always edit their responses -- typically to clean
up spelling, etc.&nbsp;
In some circumstances, if there is a concern that users may "go back and 
change history", you can restrict how long responses can be changed
after they've been entered.

<P>
<LI><B>Allow users to add new items?</B><BR>
When this box is checked, it means that any member may start a new
item.&nbsp;
When cleared, only organizers may start new items.
<P>
It's usually a good idea to allow anyone in the conference to start
new items.&nbsp;
Sometimes, if the conference is highly structured, or if the members
are new to Caucus, it may be useful to turn this capability off
at first.&nbsp;
Then later, when the members have gotten used to the structure or
to Caucus, you can turn it back on.

<P>
<LI><B>Allow item creator to Freeze, Delete, and Rename Item?</B><BR>
Item creators have certain abilities to control the item as a whole.&nbsp;
Normally they can freeze the item, rename it (change the title), or
even completely delete the item and all of its responses.
<P>
If those abilities should be reserved to the organizers, clear this
box.

<P>
<LI><B>Make the conference name visible to non-members?</B><BR>
If checked, this means your conference can appear in the lists
of conferences at the Caucus Center page -- even to someone who
is not allowed to join your conference.

<P>
If cleared, your conference name will only appear to people who
can join the conference.

<P>
<LI><B>Allow HTML text in items?</B><BR>
When a user enters the text of a response into Caucus, they
are offered several choices as to how to treat this text.&nbsp;
One choice treats the text as "raw" HTML, so that any HTML
codes in the text get interpreted as if they were part of
a web page.
<P>
This can be a very powerful way to liven up the presentation
of information, for users who either know HTML or can cut and paste
from an HTML document.&nbsp;
In rare cases, that same power can be abused to create annoyances,
or to mess up the rest of the display of an item.&nbsp;
Clearing this checkbox disallows the entry or display of HTML
responses.&nbsp;
(You may also wish to see the <B>Prohibted Tags</B> section, further
down the <B>Customize Users</B> page.&nbsp;
This provides a finer-grained control of HTML tags, and lets you
prohibit only certain parts of HTML.)


<P>
<LI><B>Allow CML text in items?</B><BR>
CML is the Caucus Markup Language; it extends HTML with a variety
of Caucus-specific functions.&nbsp;
Otherwise this question is similar to the previous one.&nbsp;
(It is probably best to disallow this capability unless there is
a specific need for it.)


<P>
<LI><B>Allow copying responses in (and into) this conference?</B><BR>
At the bottom of each item, near the response box, is a link labelled
<U><FONT COLOR=BLUE>Act on checked responses</FONT></U>.&nbsp;
From this link, users may copy responses from one item to another, 
or even from an item in another conference to an item in this
conference.
<P>
Mostly this is very useful, especially to keep discussions "on track"
by moving responses that are "drifting" to a new topic, to a new item
of their own.&nbsp;
It can also be used to archive or prune just the "important" responses 
in a long discussion to a new "summary" item.
<P>
Sometimes, however, it is better if only the organizer has this power.&nbsp;
So you can use this switch to turn off this ability for regular members.

<P>
<LI><B>Allow selected items to have anonymous responses?</B><BR>
Sometimes it is useful to have truly anonymous discussions.&nbsp;
Turning this switch "on" (checked) means that item creators have the
choice of allowing anonymous <B>or</B> or the usual "signed" responses.&nbsp;
The item creator or an organizer may switch the item back and forth
between anonymous or "signed" (but anonymous responses always stay
anonymous).

<P>
<LI><B>Allow members to set their own e-mail notification schedules?</B><BR>
If e-mail notification of new material has been enabled for your
conference, you will also see this choice.&nbsp;
Normally you, the organizer, get to set the e-mail notification schedule
(how often all members receive e-mail summarizing new material
in the conference).
<P>
With this switch, you may also allow individual members to set their
own notification schedules, which can override the schedule that
you set up.

</UL>


<P>&nbsp;<P>
<b>5.	Other Functions of the Organizer</b><p>
<p>
The primary responsibility of an organizer is to keep the conference running
smoothly.&nbsp; The conference participants expect the organizer to answer
questions, monitor the progress of the conference, assist in any communications
difficulties, and in general help keep the conference well structured.<p>
<p>
As organizer, you may want to structure the first few items of the conference.
For example, Item 1 could explain the intents and purposes of the conference,
Item 2 could be a place to discuss questions about Caucus, and Item 3 could be
reserved for special bulletins or other timely announcements, such as "Class
registration begins tomorrow, June 17, at 8:30 am".<p>
<p>
The organizer also has the ability to change the text of any item or response
in the conference, regardless of who entered it.&nbsp; This ability, however, should
be used sparingly.&nbsp; A typical example would be helping a user make the text of
his or her item more readable.&nbsp; If an interpersonal problem occurs in a
discussion on the conference, as organizer you can intervene or even censor
parts of the discussion.&nbsp; Fortunately, such problems are rare.<p>
<p>
To change the text of an item or response, simply click on the <b>edit</b>
button next to that text.&nbsp; 
Normally this button only appears next to responses
that you wrote; but since you are an organizer, it appears next to all items
and responses.
<P>
If your computer system hosts many different conferences with several
organizers, you may want to start a conference specifically for organizers.
This is a good way to share information and ideas about how to best set up and
maintain a conference.<p>
