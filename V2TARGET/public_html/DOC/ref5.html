<P>
CML pages are like mini-programs.&nbsp;  They contain directives which
control which lines of HTML code will actually get sent to the
browser, or control how many times a set of HTML lines will be
evaluated.&nbsp;  

<P>
The directives are:
<TABLE>
<TR VALIGN=top>

   <LI><A HREF="#for">For</A>
   <LI><A HREF="#count">Count</A>

</TABLE>

Plus an "<B>end</B>" directive, that closes the
"for", "count", "while", "if", "elif", and "else" directives.

<P>&nbsp;<P>
<A NAME="for"><B>5.1 For</B></A>

<P>
The CML "for" loop evaluates a set of lines multiple
times.&nbsp;  It looks like:

<P>
<PRE>

     <B>for</B> <I>variable1</I> [<I>variable2</I> ... ] <B>in</B> <I>list</I>
          (HTML code or other CML directive code)
          ...
     end
</PRE>

<P>
where <I>variable1, variable2</I> etc. are names, and <I>list</I>
is a list of words or values.&nbsp;  Typically <I>list</I> may be the
result of a CML function.&nbsp;  The for loop evaluates the lines between
"for" and "end", substituting the words in
<I>list</I> as the values of <I>variable1</I>, <I>variable2</I>, etc.&nbsp;
(The brackets simply mean that <I>variable2</I>, etc. are
optional.&nbsp;  The brackets would not actually appear in the syntax
of the for loop.)

<P>
For example, the loop:

<P>
<PRE>
     <B>for</B> x <B>in</B> abc qrs xy
          ...
     end
</PRE>

<P>
will evaluate the lines between "for" and "end"
three times, using each word in <I>list</I>.&nbsp;  (If there are no
words, the lines will be skipped.)&nbsp;  The first time through the
loop, <I>x</I> will have as its value "abc".&nbsp;
The second time it will have the value "qrs", and so on.

<P>
A different example shows the use of multiple <I>variables</I>:


<PRE>
     <B>for</B> one two <B>in</B> alpha beta delta gamma
         ...
     end
</PRE>

<P>
The first time through the loop, <I>one</I> will have the value
"alpha" and <I>two</I> will have the value "beta".&nbsp;
The second time, <I>one</I> will have the value "delta",
and so on.

<P>
The indenting of each line as shown above is not necessary, but
it is a good idea.&nbsp;  It helps make the CML code much more readable.

<P>&nbsp;<P>
<A NAME="count"><B>5.2 Count</B></A>

<P>
The CML "count" loop is similar to the "for"
loop.&nbsp;  It looks like:

<P>
<PRE>
     <B>count</B> <I>variable</I> <I>x y</I>
          (HTML code or other CML directive code)
          ...
     end
</PRE>

<P>
where <I>variable</I> is a name, and <I>x</I> and <I>y</I> are
numeric values or expressions.&nbsp;  The count loop will evaluate the
lines between "count" and "end" one time for
each integer value between <I>x</I> and <I>y</I>, inclusive.&nbsp;
The first time, variable will have the value <I>x</I>.&nbsp;  
Then <I>x</I>+1,
and so on, up to and including <I>y</I>.&nbsp;  If <I>y</I> is less
than <I>x</I>, the lines will be skipped entirely.


<P>&nbsp;<P>
<A NAME="while"><B>5.3 While</B></A>

<P>
The CML "while" loop is perhaps the simplest loop control
directive.&nbsp;  It has the form:

<P>
<PRE>
     <B>while</B> <I>expression</I>
          (HTML code or other CML directive code)
          ...
     end
</PRE>

<P>
The "while" loop evaluates <I>expression</I>, and examines
the first word of the result.&nbsp;  If it is a number, not equal to
0, all of the lines between "while" and "end"
are evaluated.&nbsp;  The loop then repeats, re-evaluating <I>expression</I>,
and so on.&nbsp;  The "while" loop will continue to execute
as long as <I>expression</I> is non-zero, so be careful!

<P>&nbsp;<P>

<A NAME="if"><B>5.4 If</B></A>

<P>
The CML "if" statement evaluates a set of lines if a
certain condition is true.&nbsp;  It looks like:

<P>
<PRE>
     if <I>condition</I>
          (HTML code or other CML directive code)
          ...
     end
</PRE>

where <I>condition</I> is some expression.&nbsp;  If there is at least
one word in <I>condition</I>, and the first word is a non-zero
number, then the enclosed set of lines will be evaluated once.&nbsp;
Otherwise they will be skipped.&nbsp;  (Also see the related functions
<A HREF="ref405.html#if">$if()</A> and
<A HREF="ref405.html#ifthen">$ifthen()</A>.)


<P>&nbsp;<P>
<A NAME="elif"><B>5.5 Elif</B></A>

<P>
The "if" statement may be extended to handle multiple
exclusive cases with the "elif" directive.&nbsp;  It looks
like:

<P>
<PRE>
     if <I>condition1</I>
          (HTML code or other CML directive code)
          ...
     end

     <B>elif</B> <I>condition2</I>
          ...
     end
</PRE>

<P>
The lines between "elif" and "end" are evaluated
when the previous "if" <I>condition1</I> failed (was
0 or did not exist) and the first word of <I>condition2</I> is
a non-zero number.

<P>
Multiple "elif"s may be strung together, one after another.&nbsp;
Only one of the blocks of CML code between the if/end and elif/end
pairs will be executed.


<P>&nbsp;<P>
<A NAME="else"><B>5.6 Else</B></A>

<P>
There is an (optional) matching "else" to the CML "if"
and "elif" statements.&nbsp;  It looks like:

<P>
<PRE>
     if <I>condition</I>
          (HTML code or other CML directive code)
          ...
     end

     <B>else</B>
          ...
     end
</PRE>

<P>
The lines between "else" and "end" are evaluated
if <I>condition</I> is 0, or does not exist at all.&nbsp;
<I>Note</I>: <I>the "if" must have its own "end"!&nbsp;
</I>"Else" may be used with just an "if", 
or a series of "if"s
and "elifs".&nbsp;  If the latter, it must be the last of
the series.


<P>&nbsp;<P>
<A NAME="set"><B>5.7 Set</B></A>

<P>
The "for" and "count" directives define the
value of a variable during iterations of the lines between the
"for" or "count", and the matching "end"
directive.&nbsp;  Outside of those loops, the variable is undefined.

<P>
A variable may also be defined across the evaluation of all CML
pages, using the "set" directive.&nbsp;  It looks like:

<P>
<PRE>
     <B>set</B> <I>variable</I> <I>x</I>
</PRE>

where <I>variable</I> is a name (or an expression that evaluates
<b>to</b> a name), and <I>x</I> is some expression.&nbsp;
For the rest of this session, <I>variable</I> has the value <I>x</I>
(unless changed by another "set" directive).&nbsp;  Variables
defined by "set" are considered "global" in
scope, i.e. the variables are available in all subsequently evaluated
CML pages.
<P>
(Also see the related function 
<A HREF="ref407.html#set">$set()</A>.)

<P>&nbsp;<P>
<A NAME="copy"><B>5.8 Copy</B></A>

<P>
The Copy directive is identical to the Set directive,
except that it preserves leading spaces (after the
one space required to separate the directive from
the expression).&nbsp;
Spaces, in this context, include blanks, tabs, newlines,
and Kanji double-wide spaces.
<P>
For example, if the "struck-out" letter 
<FONT COLOR=BLUE><STRIKE>b</STRIKE></FONT>
represents a space, then
<P>
<PRE>
   set  abc<FONT COLOR=BLUE><STRIKE>bbb</STRIKE></FONT>hello
   copy xyz<FONT COLOR=BLUE><STRIKE>bbb</STRIKE></FONT>goodbye
</PRE>
<P>
sets abc to "Hello", and xyz to 
"<FONT COLOR=BLUE><STRIKE>bb</STRIKE></FONT>goodbye".


<P>&nbsp;<P>
<A NAME="include"><B>5.9 Include</B></A>

<P>
The "include" directive includes the text of a CML file
at the current point.&nbsp;  It has the syntax:

<P>
<PRE>
     <B>include</B> filename  <I>[ arg1 [ arg2 ... ] ]</I>
</PRE>

<P>
where <I>filename</I> is the name of a file, or a set of CML functions
that evaluate to the name of a file.&nbsp;  <I>Filename</I> is relative
to the CML_Path directory specified in the swebd.conf file.&nbsp;  (See
the Caucus installation guide for details.)&nbsp;  The brackets indicate
that arguments <I>arg1</I>, <I>arg2</I>, and so on are optional
(they are not actually part of the syntax).&nbsp;  If the arguments
are present, they are available inside the included file via the
<A HREF="ref401.html#inc">$inc(n)</A> function.

<P>
Include directives are evaluated according to the current context.&nbsp;
For example:

<P>
<PRE>
     count x 1 3
          <B>include</B> file.$(x)
     end
</PRE>

<P>
would include the contents of the files <B>file.1</B>, <B>file.2</B>,
and <B>file.3</B>.

<P>
Include understands the "quoting" of multiple words as one <I>arg</I>.&nbsp;
See <A HREF="ref407.html#quote">$quote()</A> for details.


<P>&nbsp;<P>
<A NAME="return"><B>5.10 Return</B></A>

<P>
The "return" directive immediately "returns" from the current
CML file or CML include file.&nbsp;  When encountered in
a CML file, it terminates processing of that file, as if
it had "run off the end" of the file.&nbsp;
If encountered in an <A HREF="#include">include</A>d file,
it immediately "returns" to the includ<B>ing</B> file,
and continues with the line after the include directive.
<P>
Return is particularly useful in CML include files that
handle multiple conditions.&nbsp;  Return can be used to
say "I'm done with this section", rather than use if/else if
combinations to exclusively handle different conditions.&nbsp;
For example:

<P>
<PRE>
     if <I>condition 1</I>
        <I>do something</I>
        <B>return</B>
     end

     if <I>condition 2</I>
        <I>do something else</I>
        <B>return</B>
     end

     "etc...
</PRE>

A return in a main CML file has the same effect as a 
<A HREF="#quit">quit</A>.


<P>&nbsp;<P>
<A NAME="quit"><B>5.11 Quit</B></A>

<P>
The "quit" directive immediately ceases processing
of the current page, whether in a main CML <B>or</B> an 
<A HREF="#include">include</A> file.&nbsp;  
No more processing is done of that file, or any file that may
have "included" the file.
<P>
It is particularly useful in CML pages
that need to handle special case or "error" conditions.&nbsp;
For example:

<P>
<PRE>
     if <I>some "error" condition</I>
          "Location: http://www.xyz.com/errorpage.html
          "
          <B>quit</B>
     end

     #---OK, go on with the main case here...
     "Content-type: text/html
     "

     "etc...
</PRE>


<P>&nbsp;<P>
<A NAME="break"><B>5.12 Break</B></A>

<P>
The "break" directive immediately exits the innermost
"for", "count", or "while" loop,
and continues execution of the CML script after the closing "end"
of that loop.

<P>&nbsp;<P>
<A NAME="continue"><B>5.13 Continue</B></A>

<P>
The "continue" directive immediately starts the next iteration
of the innermost containing "for", "count", or "while" loop.

<P>&nbsp;<P>
<A NAME="eval"><B>5.14 Eval</B></A>

<P>
The "eval" directive simply evaluates any CML functions
on the rest of the line.&nbsp;  Any results from the evaluation are
ignored (thrown away).&nbsp;
<P>
Eval is really just a more straight-forward way of saying 
"set ignore some_function".
