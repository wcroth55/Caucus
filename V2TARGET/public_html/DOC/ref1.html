This document is the reference guide for version 5.00 of CML, the <B>C</B>aucus
<B>M</B>arkup <B>L</B>anguage.&nbsp;  CML is a scripting language
that combines HTML tags with simple programming constructs and
database functions.&nbsp;  The CML language interpreter is the core
of the World Wide Web interface to the Caucus conferencing system
(hence the name).<BR>

<P>
This guide assumes considerable familiarity with HTML, the World
Wide Web, Web browsers, and the Caucus conferencing system.&nbsp;
For more information about Caucus, see the CaucusCare home page
at <A HREF="http://caucuscare.com">http://caucuscare.com</A>.

<P>
This document is copyright &copy; 1996-2005 by CaucusCare.&nbsp;
This is a work-in-progress, and will be frequently
revised.&nbsp;  This edition corresponds to the CML interpreter provided
with the "Caucus 5.0" package.&nbsp;
Corrections and comments (but not questions) should be
sent to the author at

<p/>
<b>Caucus 4 vs. Caucus 5</b><br>
Caucus 5 marked a major transition in the handling of the underlying
Caucus data -- moving from many different "flat files" to a
(mostly) MySQL database.
<p/>
As a result, there have been major changes in the CML function list.&nbsp;
Some chapters have a separate "Caucus 4" section at the bottom; 
these functions should only be used to read "old" data, in the process
of converting it to the "new", Caucus 5, forms.&nbsp;
The list of version 4 vs version 5 functions is frankly somewhat
confusing, and occasionally incorrect.&nbsp;
This will be fixed in the near future.


<p>
<B>New features and functions in 5.x</B><br>
Once the official "base" version 5.0 has been released, 
any new functions added <b>after</b> that point
will be announced here.
