<h2>Caucus Groups in C5</h2>

<p/>
<b>I. Introduction</b><br>
The way groups are handled in Caucus is completely redone in C5,
according to the following principles.

<p/>
<ol>
<li>Every collection of people is a group.&nbsp;
   (Groups, conferences, manager privs, etc.)
<li>Groups can contain subgroups.
<li>Groups are defined by owner (userid, conf name, etc.) and group name.
<li>Groups define membership <b>and</b> access level.
<li>Groups must be usable in simple MySQL "joins" to determine who
    is in a group, and with what access level.
<li>Users may opt-out of access to a group.
<li>Groups may define opt-in access levels.
</ol>

<p/>
<b>II. Opt-out and Opt-in</b><br>
The last two points are tricky, and are driven by a design decision
about conferences.&nbsp;
In Caucus 4, each conference has a userlist, and a membership
list.&nbsp;
The userlist is the list of "invitees"; the membership list is
the set of invitees who actually "showed up", so to speak.&nbsp;
While distinguishing between the two is useful, in practice it has
led to endless confusion, and even more complicated work-arounds
such as "force join" and "auto join" for cases where the organizer
needs to <b>make</b> people be members.
<p/>
So, in C5, the userlist and the membership become one: the conference
group.&nbsp;
If your access to the conference group is readonly or higher, you
are a member.&nbsp;
Period.
<p/>
<b>However</b>, if you don't want to be a member, you can "opt out"
of a group.&nbsp;
As implemented, it means you can add an opt-out rule to a group
that you belong to.&nbsp;
If you change your mind (again), you can remove your opt-out rule,
and get back your original access.
<p/>
Opt-in is similar.&nbsp;
Whoever owns a group can define opt-in access for a set of people.&nbsp;
They are not members of the group, but they can <b>choose</b> to
add themselves to the group, with whatever access level the
owner originally specified.


<p/>
<b>III. The Formal Details</b><br>
The rest of this document lays out 
the details and formal definitions of these principles.&nbsp;
Take a deep breath and read onward!

<p/>
<ol>
<li><b>Every collection of people is a group.</b>&nbsp;
Groups are groups.&nbsp;
Conference user lists are groups.&nbsp;
Item access lists (new in C5) are groups.&nbsp;
Manager privileges are groups.&nbsp; Etc.

<p/>
<li><b>Groups contain userids, or other groups.</b>&nbsp;
   Each entry in a group is called a "rule".&nbsp;
   E.g. a group G that contains userid A, userid B, and group X
   has three rules, one each for A and B, and one for X.&nbsp;
   (For now, when a group is contained in another group, 
   it is shown with a preceding "&lt;" as in C4.)

<p/>
<li><b>Userids in groups may have wildcards.</b>&nbsp;
  The MySQL "LIKE" syntax is used, 
   e.g. "user%" or "%_class" or "abc%xyz".&nbsp;
  Asterisks in C4 groups are translated to %'s.

<p/>
<li><b>All groups are owned by someone or something.</b>&nbsp;
Group names take the form:
<p/>
<ul>
<i>owner<b>.</b>name</i>
</ul>
<p/>
Owners can be:
<ul>
<li>"CONF".&nbsp;  E.g. CONF.demo is the userlist for conference "demo".
<li>"MGR".&nbsp; Special manager groups are owned by "MGR".
<li>A userid.&nbsp;  E.g. "roth.special" is owned by userid "roth".&nbsp;
</ul>
<p/>
Note that all userids are lower-case, and all "special" owners
are all upper-case.&nbsp;
Additional categories of special owners may be added later,
such as the C4 "interface" groups that record who was registered
under which interface.
<p/>
Currently, everyone can read or use all groups.&nbsp;
Userid groups (e.g. "roth.special") can be edited or deleted by the owning
userid.&nbsp;
Conference groups (e.g. "CONF.demo") can be edited by the matching
conference organizers.&nbsp;
All groups may be edited by members of "mgr.groups" (the managers with
"edit groups" privilege).

<p/>
<li><b>Rules define access</b>.&nbsp;
Each rule selects a userid or group, <b>and</b> an access level, 
<b>and</b>
whether that is "real" or "optional" access.&nbsp;
Access levels are represented internally by integers, and in the
user interface by keywords.&nbsp;
There is an "out-of-the-box" list of standard access levels, 
and custom (site) levels may also be added.

<p/>
The standard access levels are:
<ul>
<table>
<tr><td><b>Keyword</b></td>  <td><b>Value</b></td>  
    <td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td> <td><b>Description</b></td>
<tr><td>organizer</td>   <td align=right>40</td> <td></td>
    <td>Full management powers for whatever the group is used in</td>
<tr><td>instructor</td>  <td align=right>30</td> <td></td>
    <td>(limited organizer powers)</td>
<tr><td>include</td>     <td align=right>20</td>
<tr><td>readonly</td>    <td align=right>10</td>
<tr><td>exclude</td>  <td align=right>0</td> <td></td>
    <td>No access</td>
<tr><td>inherit</td>  <td align=right>-1</td> <td></td>
    <td>Inherit actual access level from subgroup</td>
</table>
</ul>

<p/>
If a rule lists a userid but no access level, then the default
level of "include" is implied.&nbsp;
The precise implications of an access level depend on what
a group is used for.&nbsp;
E.g. for a conference the levels are pretty clear, but
for a group that defines manager privs, everything above "exclude"
means you have that priv, and everything below means you do not
have that priv.&nbsp;
Ditto emailing everyone in a group, and so on.
<p/>
If an access level is "optional", then users do not have any access,
and are not considered members --
except that they have the ability to add a rule to the group with 
the "real" equivalent access.&nbsp;
(Optional exclude access is probably meaningless -- generally
anyone with real access in a group can exclude themselves.&nbsp;
This may be prohibited separately at the interface level, e.g.
a conference organizer may turn off the ability to for users
to exclude themselves.)

<p/>
<li><b>Rules may inherit or override.</b>&nbsp;
When a rule in group G references another group X (i.e. a subgroup), 
it is interpreted in one of two ways:
<ol>
<li>If the rule access in G is inherit, then the rules in X are inherited
exactly as they are (i.e. as if those rules were copied directly into G).
<li>Otherwise, the rule in G applies to everyone in X who has readonly
or higher access in X.
</ol>

<p/>
Example:
<ul>
<table border=0>
<tr valign=top>
<td><b>Group G</b><br>
&lt;M include<br>
&lt;F inherit</td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
<td><b>Group M</b><br>
alfred readonly<br>
bob include<br>
charlie organizer<br>
dexter exclude</td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
<td><b>Group F</b><br>
alice readonly<br>
betty include<br>
charlotte organizer<br>
debby exclude</td>
</table>
</ul>

<p/>
Group G's rules yield the following access:
<ul>
<li>Include: alfred, bob, charlie, betty
<li>Readonly: alice
<li>Organizer: charlotte
</ul>

<p/>
<li><b>Exclude wins.&nbsp; Then highest access wins.</b>&nbsp;
If more than one rule in a group applies to a userid 
(including rules from subgroups), then:
<ul>
<li>Any exclude rule for that userid wins.&nbsp;
(Opt-out acts like exclude.)
<li>Otherwise, the highest (most privileged) access wins.
</ul>
<p/>
Example: if we modified group G above to add two new rules:
<ul>
dexter include<br>
debby include
</ul>
<p/>
Then dexter would have include access (because he is effectively
<b>not in</b> group M), but debby would still be excluded, because
the inherited exclude rule from F wins over the new include rule in G.

<p/>
<li><b>Assume simplicity.</b>&nbsp;
The group structure as presented is complex, if thorough.&nbsp;
But in most cases, the interface need only present the simplest
aspects of the groups.&nbsp;
Only if a user chooses to invoke a more complex option (such
as wildcards or inheritance or optional access) 
do the relevant interface options appear.&nbsp;
<p/>
So, for example, most of the time the access rule "include" is assumed
when including groups within groups.

<p/>
The "exclude" concept, in particular, adds a lot of complexity.&nbsp;
But in general it is only needed to counter the effects of a wild-card
match, such as "give everyone access <b>except</b> certain people".&nbsp;
In most cases, neither wild-cards nor exclude will be used, and
the interface can appear correspondingly simpler.&nbsp;

<p/>
<li><b>Group rules define JOINable groups table.</b>&nbsp;
The implementation of the groups rules is done via two tables: 
'grouprules' and 'groups'.&nbsp;
The rules as described above are recorded in 'grouprules'.&nbsp;
The 'groups' table records the relationship between every userid
and <b>every</b> group.&nbsp;
The idea is that 'groups' can be used in simple MySQL "joins"
when a query needs to be restricted by membership in a group.

<p/>
More precisely, each row in 'groups' has a structure something like:
<pre>
   userid   varchar
   group    varchar
   access   int</pre>

The values in 'groups' are totally derived from the rules in
'grouprules'.&nbsp;
Every time a group is changed and the relevant rows in 'grouprules'
are changed, <b>all</b> rows in 'groups' that reference the changed group,
either directly <b>or through included layers of subgroups</b>, are updated
to match.&nbsp;
(This also means that any time a new userid is added, any wild-card
group rules must be scanned for matches against the new userid, and
the 'groups' table similarly updated.&nbsp;
Thus, determining group membership and access is very fast and simple,
but changing group membership is expensive.)
<p/>
Thus, from our previous example, 'groups' would have a
row for (userid='alfred', group='M'), <b>and</b>
a row for (userid='alfred', group='G').

<p/>
This means it is possible (and easy!) to craft queries such as
<pre>
   SELECT userid, access FROM groups WHERE group='G'</pre>
and still get a list of <b>all</b> the userids that belong to
group G, and their access level, 
no matter how many layers of included sub-groups are involved.

</ol>
