<P>
Each CML page (or file) describes a page that will appear on the
user's Web browser.&nbsp;  
(In some cases it just produces an HTTP &quot;Location&quot;
directive which points in turn to another CML or HTML file.)&nbsp;
CML can be thought of as a superset of HTML.&nbsp;  More precisely,
HTML is embedded in CML scripts; swebs does not actually understand
or parse the HTML codes.&nbsp;  A CML page contain five kinds of text:

<P>
<OL>
<LI>Comments.&nbsp;  In the Unix tradition, all lines beginning with
&quot;#&quot; are comments and are ignored.&nbsp;  Entirely blank lines
are also ignored.

<P>
<LI>HTML code.&nbsp;  All lines beginning with a double quote (&quot;)
are parsed for CML functions and macros, but are otherwise passed on to the
browser unchanged.&nbsp;  (The quote is removed.)&nbsp;  There may be leading
blanks before the quote; they are ignored.

<P>
<LI>CML functions.&nbsp;  Strings of the form $xyz(), $xyz(value), or
$(value) are parsed by swebs, and replaced by the appropriate
Caucus values.

<P>
<LI>CML macros.&nbsp;  Strings of the form %abc(args)
are macro invocations, and are expanded by swebs.&nbsp;
See <A HREF="ref31.html">CML macro definitions and expansions</A>
for more information.

<P>
<LI><A HREF="ref5.html">CML directives</A>.&nbsp;  
    Directives are like C program code: they describe
actions to be taken.&nbsp;  Directives start with one of the keywords
"if", "elif", "else", "for",
"count", "while", "set", "include",
"return", "quit", "break", or "end".
</OL>

<P>
A single logical line in a CML file may be broken across several
physical lines; a &quot;\&quot; as the last character means &quot;continued
on next (physical) line&quot;.&nbsp;  Most of the time this is not needed,
since HTML mostly ignores line boundaries.&nbsp;  However, the &quot;\&quot;
is useful for assembling long lines that will appear inside HTML
&lt;PRE&gt; code, or to improve readability of the CML code.

<P>
Here's a sample CML page, typical of a page a Web Caucus user
would see early on:

#
#---CENTER.CML.   "Caucus Center" Page.
#
#   Overview of (and initial entry to) conferences.
#
#-----------------------------------------------------------------------

end

              # $(center_name) )

"&lt;/HEAD&gt;

"&lt;BODY $(body_bg) &gt;

#---Caucus header.

#---Tell the user what this page is about.

"&lt;TD ALIGN=right&gt;
   include $(dir)/youare.i
"&lt;/TD&gt;
"&lt;/TABLE&gt;

"&lt;P&gt;

"&lt;A HREF="$(href)/allconfs.cml?$(nch)+$(nxt)+x+x+x+x+x+x"&gt;
"see a list of &lt;B&gt;all&lt;/B&gt; conferences&lt;/A&gt; on this host.
"&lt;P&gt;

#---Prepare to actually put up various kinds of links to the
#   conferences.  Create some variables with lists of 
#   conference names.  Apply $cl_list() to the entire list
#   of conferences.
#     L_CONFS are the "popular" conferences.
#     M_CONFS are from the user's personal conference list
set l_confs $file($(inc)/l_confs.i)
set m_confs $user_var($userid() my_confs)
set ignore  $cl_list ( $(l_confs) $(m_confs) )

#---The various ways of getting to the conferences all appear
#   as numbered entries, within one large table.
#   To avoid unpleasant spacing, and because the "JOIN" choice requires
#   being in a &lt;FORM&gt;, the entire table must be inside a &lt;FORM&gt;.
"&lt;FORM METHOD=POST ACTION="$(href)/centerf.cml?$(nch)+$(nxt)" NAME="joiner"&gt;

"&lt;TABLE CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 &gt;

#---Personal conference list access:
set way_in 1
include $(dir)/cen_pers.i $(way_in)


#---"Popular" conference access:
if $sizeof ($(l_confs))

end


#---Type a conference name directly:
set way_in $plus ($(way_in) 1)
include $(dir)/cen_type.i $(way_in)


#---See a list of all conferences:
