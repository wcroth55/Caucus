<B>1.&nbsp; Introduction</B>
<P>
This document describes the overall architecture of Caucus.&nbsp;
This includes the mechanics of how the web interface actually
works, and the location, names, and formats of the most important
files.
<P>
While it is not necessary to read or understand
this document in order to <I>use</I> or even to <I>install</I>
Caucus, it is very helpful if you intend to modify the web interface,
or to connect other applications or programs to Caucus.
<P>
This document assumes a general familiarity with HTML, Web server
management, Unix commands and processes, and the use of Caucus.

<P>

<P>&nbsp;<P>
<B>2.&nbsp; Caucus Design Goals</B>
<P>
There were seven main design goals that shaped the architecture
of Caucus:
<P>
<OL>
<LI>Allow the use of <I>any</I> Web browser to provide a graphical
user interface to Caucus conferences.&nbsp; (In practice, this has come
to mean Netscape 2 or Internet Explorer 3.02 or higher.)<BR>
<P>
<LI>Provide the tools for Webmasters to build a completely customizable
Caucus interface.&nbsp; Caucus uses &quot;CML&quot; (Caucus Mark-up
Language) scripts, which are analogous to individual HTML pages.
<P>
 Caucus includes a default set of such scripts (pages), but they
may be completely customized by the local site.&nbsp; This is in keeping
with the long-standing Caucus tradition of complete customizability.
<P>
<LI>The Caucus server was built on top of the existing Caucus
API (applications programmer interface) function library, minimizing
development time and guaranteeing data compatibility.<BR>
<P>
<LI>Caucus works side by side with existing Caucus (&quot;text
interface&quot;) software.&nbsp; A Caucus user may access conferences
through the Web <I>or</I> the text interface, without conflict.
<P>
<LI>Caucus works with existing Unix HTTP servers,
through the CGI interface.&nbsp; The Caucus server could also be adapted
to work with a custom HTTP server to provide for higher efficiency.
<P>
<LI>The Web &quot;access authorization&quot; userid and password
scheme is used to provide secure access to Caucus.&nbsp; When a userid
has been verified by the Web server, that same userid is used
to identify the particular Caucus user.&nbsp; All normal Caucus security
(access to specific conferences, etc.) applies.&nbsp;
<P>
An interface to other authorization schemes is also available as
part of the Caucus server.
<P>
<LI>Transactions between the browser and the Caucus server must
be as efficient as possible.&nbsp; The main effect of this on the design
is the creation of a dedicated &quot;sub-server&quot; process
for each user's Caucus session.
</OL>

<A NAME="diagram"><P>&nbsp;<P></A>
<B>3.&nbsp; Caucus Web Interface: Transactions</B>
<P>
This section describes what actually happens when a person uses
a Web browser to access Caucus.&nbsp;  In the steps listed below, &quot;swebd&quot;
refers to the master Caucus server process.  &quot;Swebs&quot;
is the dedicated user &quot;subserver&quot; process.  &quot;Swebsock&quot;
is a light-weight program that passes data to and from swebd.
&quot;Httpd&quot; is the standard name for the HTTP server process.
<BR>
<P>
<B>3.1 Initial connection to Caucus</B>
<P>
<OL>
<LI>The user's browser sends a connection request (over the Internet,
or a local intranet) to the host's HTTP server.
<P>
<LI>The HTTP server immediately spawns (or connects to a pre-existing)
child httpd process to handle the request.
<P>
<LI>The initial &quot;connection to the Caucus server&quot; is
actually an access-authorization (i.e., userid and password) protected
URL that runs a CGI program called swebsock.&nbsp;  Swebsock opens a
socket to Swebd (the master Caucus server).
<P>
<LI>Swebd spawns a child, called the swebs subserver, which gets
the userid from the browser.&nbsp;  The subserver is now &quot;dedicated&quot;
to this userid, and continues running on its own.&nbsp; The subserver
constructs the initial HTML page, and passes it (along with its
process id and a unique security code) back to swebsock.&nbsp;  Swebsock
passes everything back through the HTTP server child to the browser.
</OL>
<P>
This process is illustrated in the following diagram:
<P>
<IMG SRC="archit1.gif" WIDTH=583 HEIGHT=236>
<P>
<B>3.2 Subsequent requests</B>
<P>
Once the initial connection is made, all subsequent Caucus requests
by the browser are passed through to the dedicated swebs subserver.
Each such request uses a particular CML script as part of the
URL.&nbsp;  Such a request will produce the following sequence of events:
<BR>
<P>
<OL>
<LI>The browser sends the new request to the HTTP server.<BR>
<P>
<LI>The HTTP server immediately spawns (or  reuses) a child httpd
to handle the request.<BR>
<P>
<LI>The httpd child starts a new instance of swebsock, which passes
the request on to the dedicated subserver.&nbsp; The subserver reads
(or writes) the requested information to the Caucus database,
through the Caucus API.&nbsp; The subserver then formats the information
according to the codes in the requested CML page, and passes the
resulting dynamically created HTML page back through the HTTP
server child to the browser.<BR>
</OL>
<P>
This process is illustrated in the following diagram:
<P>
<IMG SRC="archit2.gif" WIDTH=630 HEIGHT=285>
<P>
<B>3.3 Notes</B>
<P>
<OL>
<LI>In the diagrams, the large dashed boxes are computer systems.
The small boxes are processes, and the rounded boxes are disk
files.&nbsp; Lines indicate communication paths, either HTTP, CGI (stdin/stdout),
sockets, or file reading and writing.<BR>
<P>
<LI>Note that <I>each</I> browser request involves one or two
new processes: the HTTP child, and the CGI swebsock.&nbsp;  These processes
are kept as lightweight as possible.<BR>
<P>
<LI>In contrast, since there is one swebs subserver per user, and
each subserver persists across the entire user's browser session,
the subservers cache all sorts of information.&nbsp; The subserver also
has a timeout period -- i.e., after a certain period with no requests,
it exits.&nbsp;  Otherwise the system might fill up with inactive subservers.
</OL>

<P>&nbsp;<P>
<B>4. CML: The Caucus Markup Language</B>
<P>
<B>4.1 CML Description</B>
<P>
The entire Caucus user interface is built out of CML ("Caucus Markup Language")
scripts or pages.&nbsp;
CML can be thought of as a superset of HTML, with an embedded
scripting programming language that is interpreted (by the "swebs" process)
<I>on the server</I>.&nbsp;
Thus, CML pages can not only generate dynamic HTML, but also access
the Caucus database on the server, and other files or even programs
on the server.

<P>
CML as a language contains most of the standard control directives
that one would find in any programming language (if/else, loops, etc.),
plus a rich set of functions for manipulating web data, Caucus database
data, and connections to other programs or files.&nbsp;
It is not strictly speaking a superset of HTML (in that it does not
understand or parse HTML), but in practice most CML pages contain
a large amount of embedded HTML, plus some CML control statements
and functions.

<P>
CML pages contain 4 kinds of text:
<P>
<OL>
<LI><B>Comments</B>.&nbsp; In the Unix tradition, all lines beginning
with &quot;#&quot; are comments and are ignored.&nbsp; Entirely blank
lines are also ignored.<BR>
<P>
<LI><B>HTML code</B>.&nbsp;  All lines beginning with a single quote
(&quot;) are parsed for CML functions, but are otherwise passed
on (as HTML) to the browser.&nbsp;  (The quote is removed.)
<P>
<LI><B>CML functions</B>.&nbsp;  Strings of the form &quot;$xyz()&quot;,
&quot;$xyz(value)&quot;, or &quot;$(value)&quot; are parsed and
replaced by the appropriate Caucus values.&nbsp;  The CML functions
are described in the 
<A HREF="http://caucuscare.com/TLIB/CMLREF">CML Reference Guide</A>.
<P>
<LI><B>CML directives</B>.&nbsp;  Directives are like C program code:
they describe actions to be taken.&nbsp;  Directives include conditional
statements (&quot;if&quot; and &quot;else&quot;) and loop controls
(&quot;for&quot; and &quot;count&quot;).
</OL>
<P>
A single logical line may be broken across several physical lines;
a &quot;\&quot; as the last character means &quot;continued on
next (physical) line&quot;.&nbsp; This is generally unneeded, except
for HTML &lt;PRE&gt; text that is being built out of mixed text
and CML functions.<BR>
<BR>
<P>
<B>4.2 CML directives</B>
<P>
The CML directives provide some simple control structures recognizable
from other programming languages, including:
<P>
<UL>
<PRE>
   for <I>variable</I> in <I>list</I>

   count <I>variable first_val last_val</I>

   if <I>condition</I>

   else

   set <I>variable value</I>
</PRE>
</UL>
<P>
For more information, see the 
<A HREF="http://caucuscare.com/TLIB/CMLREF">CML Reference Guide</A>.
<P>
<B>4.3 CML functions<BR>
</B>
<P>
All CML functions evaluate to strings of characters.&nbsp;  There is
no other data type.&nbsp;  The same holds true for CML variables.&nbsp;  The
CML functions provide access to Caucus data, browser and server
control, string manipulation, and logic functions.&nbsp;  Again, see
the reference guide.<BR>

<P>&nbsp;<P>
<B>5. Layout of Caucus files</B>
<P>
This section describes the layout of the Caucus files -- their
location and purpose.&nbsp;  All of the files live in or under the Caucus
home directory, and (unless explicitly noted elsewhere) should
always be owned by the Caucus userid.<BR>
<P>
<B>Important: </B>If you are editing these files for any purpose,
you must do it while logged in as the Caucus userid.&nbsp;  In particular,
do <I><B>not</B></I> modify the Caucus files, or run the conference
management programs, while logged in as &quot;root&quot; or &quot;administrator&quot;.
<BR>
<P>
<B>5.1 CML pages<BR>
</B>
<P>
The CML pages control the precise look and feel of the Caucus
web interface.&nbsp;  They are all located under the CML directory.&nbsp;
As a site may have multiple (distinct) interfaces, each interface
gets its own sub-directory under CML.&nbsp;  The default set of CML
pages is contained in the directory <B>CML/CC44</B>.
<P>
The CML pages are ordinary ascii text files, usually called something.cml,
or something.i (for &quot;include&quot; -- files included in other
.cml files).&nbsp;  Each CML interface (such as <B>CML/CC44</B>) also
has a special subdirectory called <B>&quot;Local&quot;</B>.&nbsp;  This
contains files that are intended to be changed for your local
site, and that will not be touched or replaced the next time you
install a Caucus upgrade.<BR>
<P>
Two particularly important files in the Local subdirectory:
<P>
<UL>
<LI><B>switch.i</B> contains common &quot;switches&quot; that may
be set for your site to change how Caucus behaves.<BR>
<P>
<LI><B>l_confs.i</B> is a list of conference names that will appear under
&quot;Popular Conferences&quot; on the Caucus Welcome page.<BR>
</UL>
<P>
See the header comments in these files for more information. 

<P>
In addition to the conferencing interface in <B>CML/CC44/main</B>,
there is also a separate (and small) interface in <B>CML/CC44/reg</B>.&nbsp;
This set of CML pages is entirely dedicated to registering a
userid and password for a new user.&nbsp;  (It must be a separate interface,
because it will be used by people who have not yet gotten or been
assigned a userid and password!)<BR>
<BR>
<P>
<B>5.2 The SWEB CGI directory<BR>
</B>
<P>
The SWEB directory contains CGI programs and related files that
are used to start up the regular Web interface to Caucus.
<P>
<UL>
<LI><B>swebd</B> is the Caucus master server program
<P>
<LI><B>swebs</B> is the Caucus "subserver" program
<P>
<LI><B>swebd.conf</B> is the configuration file for swebd
<P>
<LI><B>swebsock</B> is the CGI program that communicates between httpd and
swebd
<P>
<LI><B>.htaccess</B> is a file that makes <B>SWEB</B> an access-controlled
directory (NCSA httpd)
<P>
<LI><B>cpw1</B> is a program to modify the httpd password file
<P>
<LI><B>start.cgi</B> is a CGI script used  to interpret &quot;special&quot;
Caucus URLs, such as &quot;http://hostname/caucus/conference_name/item_number.
</UL>
<P>
<B>5.3 The REG CGI directory<BR>
</B>
<P>
The REG directory contains CGI programs and related files that
are used to start up the &quot;register a userid&quot; interface.
 This includes:<BR>
<P>
<UL>
<LI><B>swebsock</B> is a copy of or link to the SWEB/swebsock program
</UL>
<P>
<B>5.4 The SOCKET directory<BR>
</B>
<P>
The various Caucus programs (swebd, swebs, swebsock) communicate
with each other via a data path called &quot;sockets&quot;.&nbsp;  The
sockets must have a name and a location; therefore they are placed
in this directory.
<P>
<UL>
<LI><B>sweb</B> is a socket to master swebd server
<P>
<LI>sweb<B>nnnnnn</B> is a socket for a particular swebs subserver, process
number <B>nnnnnn</B>
<P>
<LI><B>debug</B>: if this file exists, debugging logs are created for
<B>swebd, swebs,</B> and <B>swebsock.</B>
</UL>
<P>
<B>5.5 The public_html directory</B>
<P>
A URL of the form &quot;http://yourhost/~caucus/xyz.html&quot;
looks for the file <B>xyz.html</B> in the <B>public_html</B> directory.&nbsp;
(Depending on your httpd server, you may have renamed <B>public_html</B>
to something else.)&nbsp;  Caucus keeps some specific files in this
directory:<BR>
<P>
<UL>
<LI><B>caucus.html</B> is a simple HTML page to link to Caucus interface
(via <B>SWEB/caucus.cgi</B>) and to the &quot;register a userid&quot;
interface (via <B>REG/register.cgi</B>).<BR>
<P>
<LI><B>GIF41</B> is a directory containing gif and jpeg images used by
Caucus interface.
</UL>
<P>
<B>5.8 The Cnnnn conference directories</B>
<P>
The conference data for a particular conference is stored in a
single directory.&nbsp;  Each conference has a unique four digit number;
thus, the data for conference number 1 is stored in the directory
C0001.
<P>
Conference data is always stored in &quot;flat&quot; ascii text
files.&nbsp;  In theory this means that the Caucus manager may edit
these files directory.&nbsp;  In practice you should never do this without
specific instructions from Screen Porch technical support staff.
 This information is provided purely for reference; Screen Porch
is not responsible for the results of unauthorized tinkering with
these files.
<P>
Important files:
<P>
<UL>
<LI><B>userlist</B> contains the permissions list of who may or may not access
this conference
<P>
<LI><B>masteres</B> is the master list of items and number of responses to
each item
<P>
<LI><B>0010000000</B> is the text of item 1 (and some responses)
<P>
<LI><B>0050210000</B> is the text of item 5, response 21 (and some following
responses)
<P>
<LI><B>introduc</B> is the conference &quot;introduction&quot;
<P>
<LI><B>greet</B> is the conference &quot;greeting&quot;
<P>
<LI><B>membr001</B> is the list of conference members
<P>
<LI><B>variable</B> contains conference variables (from CML $set_conf_var()
function)
</UL>
<P>
<B>5.10 USER001, Caucus user files<BR>
</B>
<P>
In addition to the conference-specific files, and the Caucus-wide
data files, there is also data stored about each user.&nbsp;  Data files
for a userid <B>alpha</B> are stored under <B>USER001/alpha</B>.&nbsp;
(Some systems enforce so-called &quot;sanity limits&quot; on
the number of sub-directories in a directory; if your system is
one of them, Caucus may automatically create directories USER002,
USER003, and so forth as needed.)<BR>
<P>
Important files in each user directory:
<P>
<UL>
<LI><B>register</B> contains &quot;registration&quot; information about this
person, including their name, telephone number, brief self-description
(introduction), and so forth.
<P>
<LI><B>p000100</B> is the participation record in conference 1
</UL>
<P>
<B>5.11 TEXT001, temporary user files<BR>
</B>
<P>
Temporary files created for each user (for example, during the
entry or editing of items and responses) are stored here.&nbsp;  It
has the same structure as <B>USER001</B> (one sub-directory per
userid).&nbsp;  <B>Note:</B> The permissions for this directory and
its sub-directories should be write-all.<BR>
<BR>
<P>
<B>5.12 Files in the Caucus home directory</B>
<P>
There are some Caucus files which do not fit in the purposes described
for the previously listed sub-directories.&nbsp;  These files are kept
in top level of the Caucus home directory.&nbsp;
(Many of the programs and scripts are now obsoleted by the 
web-based features of the Caucus 4.0 manager's page.)
<P>
<UL>
<LI><B>caucus_passwd</B> is the password file used by NCSA httpd
<P>
<LI><B>fixdate</B> is a script to update date or &quot;SINCE&quot; information
about old conferences
<P>
<LI><B>fixmaster</B> is a script to automatically corrected corrupted C<B>nnn</B>/masteres
files
<P>
<P>
<LI><B>fixtext</B> is a script to recreate missing TEXT001 sub-directories
<P>
<LI><B>passprog</B> is a script to run the cpw1 program to modify caucus_passwd
or other httpd password file
<P>
<LI><B>swebstop</B> is a script to stop all running Caucus web-interface
processes (swebd, swebs, etc.)
<P>
<LI><B>testconf</B> is a script to test consistency of conference item
&amp; response data
