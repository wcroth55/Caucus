<P>
Several very specialized functions provide the capability to search
for and display text in the conference items and responses.

<P>
<DL>

<P><DT><A NAME="find_in_item">$find_in_item (cnum inum r0 r1 any 
                inword text)</A>
<DD>
Search conference <I>cnum</I>, item <I>inum</I>, responses <I>r0</I>
through <I>r1</I>.&nbsp;  (If <I>r1</I> is -1, search through the last
response).&nbsp;  Look for the word (or words) in <I>text</I>.

<P>
The <I>any</I> and <I>inword</I> arguments modify exactly how
and when the search succeeds.&nbsp;  If <I>any</I> is 1, the search
is successful if any of the words in text are found in a response.&nbsp;
If <I>any</I> is 0, the search succeeds only if all of the words
in text are found in the same response.&nbsp;  

<P>
If <I>inword</I>  is
1, the words in text match no matter where they are found in the
response -- including in the middle of a word in the response.
(For example, &quot;the&quot; will match &quot;o<B>the</B>r&quot;.)&nbsp;
If inword is 0, matches must occur at the beginning of a word.&nbsp;
(In that case, &quot;the&quot; will not match &quot;other&quot;,
but it  will match &quot;<B>the</B>sis&quot;.)

<P>
Find_in_item() searches item <I>inum</I> until one of two things has
happened:
<UL>
<LI>All the responses r0 through r1 have been searched, or
<LI>It has spent more than pagetime/2 seconds searching 
    (see <A HREF="ref402.html#pagetime">$pagetime()</A>).
</UL>

<P>
Find_in_item() evaluates to a "pickup" triplet, followed by a
triplet list of responses that had successful
matches.&nbsp;  
The pickup triplet is "0 0 0" if all the responses were searched.&nbsp;
Otherwise it indicates the response <B>after</B> the last response
searched, i.e. where to "pick up" with searching again on the next
call to $find_in_item().

<P>
For example, "0 0 0 17 2 5 17 2 8" means that all the responses
were searched, and responses 5 and 8 in item 2 in conference 17 
had successful matches.


<P><DT><A NAME="find_it">$find_it (cnum inum r0 r1 any inword text)</A>
<DD>
Obsolete form of $find_in_item().&nbsp;
Searches responses <I>r0</I> through <I>r1</I> without checking
time.&nbsp;
Returns just the triplet string of matches, with no "pickup" triplet.

<P><DT><A NAME="search_it">$search_it(cnum inum r0 r1 any text)</A>
<DD>
This is an obsolete form of $find_it().&nbsp;  It is equivalent to
$find_it() with an <I>inword</I> of 0.

<P><DT><A NAME="find_filter">$find_filter(size words... inword text)</A>
<DD>
Find_filter is really a text filter.&nbsp;  It is meant to be used
to display just the &quot;hits&quot; in a response that contains
a word or words searched for via $search_it().&nbsp;  It boldfaces the
searched-for words, and displays 3 lines of <I>text</I> around
each hit.

<P>
<I>Text</I> is typically the entire text of a response.&nbsp;  <I>Words</I>
contains the word or words that were searched for.&nbsp;  <I>Size</I>
is the number of distinct words in <I>words</I>.&nbsp;  <I>Inword</I>
should have the same value it did in $find_it() -- it controls
whether matches may be found in the middle of a word (<I>inword</I>
= 1), or only at the beginning of a word (<I>inword</I> = 0).


<P><DT><A NAME="search_filter">$search_filter(size words... text)</A>
<DD>
This is an obsolete form of $find_filter().&nbsp;  It is equivalent
to $find_filter() with an <I>inword</I> of 0.
