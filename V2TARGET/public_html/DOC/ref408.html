  <p>There is a family of functions that provide basic
information
about conferences.&nbsp; All of these functions begin with "$cl_",
to indicate that they refer to information about a list of conferences
("cl", as in <b>c</b>onference <b>l</b>ist). </p>

  <p>
  </p>
  <dl>

    <p></p>

    <dt><a name="cl_list">$cl_list(names)</a> </dt>

    <dd>Evaluates to a list of conference numbers.&nbsp; If <i>names</i>
is
empty (i.e., nothing), $cl_list() evaluates to the list of all
conferences on the host that are accessible to the current user.&nbsp; If <i>names</i>
contains one or more
words, $cl_list() evaluates to the list of conferences that match
any of the words in <i>names</i> (that are accessible to the current user). &nbsp;Example:
      <p> <tt>for cnum in <b>$cl_list(</b>web
x<b>)</b></tt> </p>

      <p>$cl_list() becomes the list of all conferences whose
names start
with "web" or with "x".&nbsp; (The "for"
loop thus sets <tt>cnum</tt>
to each such conference number in turn.) </p>
The list of conference numbers is sorted, not by number,
but by the name of each conference, regardless of the order of
the arguments to $cl_list(). &nbsp;Sorting is independent of
upper/lower case, i.e. they are sorted as if all the conference names
were in lower case.

      <p></p>

    </dd>

    <dt><a name="cl_num">$cl_num(name)</a> </dt>

    <dd>Evaluates to the number of the conference whose name
matches <i>name</i>.&nbsp;
If there is an exact match, returns that number. &nbsp;If there are
"substring" matches (e.g. $cl_num(abc) matches "abcdef"), one of the
matches is arbitrarily selected. &nbsp;The current user must have
access to the conference in order to "see" it.
      <p></p>

    </dd>

    <dt><a name="cl_name">$cl_name(num)</a> </dt>

    <dd>Evaluates to the name of conference number <i>num</i>.&nbsp;
Note that the name may be in mixed case!
      <p></p>
