<P>
The &quot;re_&quot; functions provide information about a particular
response.&nbsp;  As in the previous section, <I>cnum</I> refers to a
conference number, <I>inum</I> to an item number, and <I>rnum</I>
to a response number.

<P>
<DL>

<P><DT><A NAME="re_exists">$re_exists(cnum inum rnum)</A>
<DD>
Evaluates to &quot;1&quot; if the response exists, and &quot;0&quot;
if the response does not exist or was deleted.

<P><DT><A NAME="re_author">$re_author(cnum inum rnum)</A>
<DD>
Evaluates to the full name of the author (at the time the response
was written).

<P><DT><A NAME="re_owner">$re_owner(cnum inum rnum)</A>
<DD>
Evaluates to the userid of the author (owner) of the response.

<P><DT><A NAME="re_time">$re_time(cnum inum rnum)</A>
<DD>
Evaluates to the time and date the response was written.

<P><DT><A NAME="re_text">$re_text(cnum inum rnum)</A>
<DD>
Evaluates to the text of the response.

<P><DT><A NAME="re_prop">$re_prop(cnum inum rnum)</A>
<DD>
Evaluates to the text 
<A HREF="prop.html">property number</A> of the response.&nbsp;  (The
property numbers are, for the moment, arbitrary, but are being
used to distinguish how the user meant a response to be displayed
-- e.g., as literal text with explicit line breaks, as plain text
to be reformatted as simple HTML, or as explicit HTML as written
by the responder.)

<P><DT><A NAME="re_title">$re_title(cnum inum rnum)</A>
<DD>
Evaluates to the title of the response.&nbsp;  Only response 0 has
a title, which is the title of the item.

<P><DT><A NAME="re_delete">$re_delete(cnum inum rnum)</A>
<DD>
Deletes specified response.&nbsp;  If <I>rnum</I> is 0, deletes entire
item.&nbsp;  Only the owner of the item or response (or an organizer)
can successfully delete an item or response.

<P><DT><A NAME="re_epoch">$re_epoch(cnum inum rnum)</A>
<DD>
Evaluates to &quot;epoch&quot; timing (number of seconds since
Jan 1 1970) when this response was written.

<P><DT><A NAME="re_bits">$re_bits(cnum inum rnum)</A>
<DD>
Evaluates to any special properties  possesed by this particular
response.&nbsp;  A bit value of 0x10 means the response was originally
written by an organizer.

<P><DT><A NAME="re_copier">$re_copier(cnum inum rnum)</A>
<DD>
Evaluates to the userid of the person who <B>copied</B> this
response to its current location.&nbsp;
(If the response was not copied, this evaluates to nothing, i.e.
an empty string.)

<P><DT><A NAME="re_copied">$re_copied(cnum inum rnum)</A>
<DD>
Evaluates to the "copied" string stored by 
response adding functions.&nbsp;
It contains the data "<I>conference_name item response date time</I>".&nbsp;
(If the response was not copied, this evaluates to nothing, i.e.
an empty string.)

</DL>

<P>
Note: as in chapter 4.13, all of these functions may be written
with <I>no</I> arguments.&nbsp;  In that case, the arguments from the
previous use of any of these functions (in the same CML page)
that <I>did</I> have arguments, are re-used.
