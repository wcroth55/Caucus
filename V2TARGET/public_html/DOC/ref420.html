<P>
Caucus defines &quot;managers&quot; as specific
users who have managerial capabilities not granted to the regular
Caucus user.&nbsp;  When Caucus is installed, one such userid is designated
the &quot;primary manager&quot;; this person has all capabilities
at all times, and cannot be removed.

<P>
The primary manager may then add other managers with more restricted
capabilities.&nbsp;  

<p/>
<ol type="I">
<li><b>Caucus 5.x</b><br>
Manager capabilities are controlled by a special set of "manager"
groups, such as "conferenceCreate".&nbsp;
This completely replaces the bit-mask approach from Caucus 4.
<p/>
Which users are in which manager groups may be determined directly
by querying the 'groups' table, or through the service functions
defined below.

<p/>
<dl>
<dt>$mgr_groups (userid)
<dd>Evaluates to a list of the manager groups that <i>userid</i>
is a member of, and the permission in each.&nbsp;
The result appears as space separated "pairs" of group name and
(numeric) group access, e.g. "conferenceCreate 10 interfaceManage 40 ...".

<p/>
<dt>$mgr_in_group (userid group1 [group2 ...])
<dd>Is <i>userid</i> in any one of the listed manager groups?&nbsp;
Evaluates to the access level of the first such group matched, or else 0.&nbsp;
(This is really just another way of getting at the same data
returned by $mgr_groups().)
</dl>

<p/>
<li><b>All versions (5.x and 4.x)</b><br>
<dl>
<DT><A NAME="admin_mail">$admin_mail()</A>
<DD>
Evaluates to the e-mail address of the Caucus administrator
(as defined in <B>swebd.conf</B>).
</dl>

<p/>
<li><b>Caucus 4.x</b><br>
Each manager capability corresponds to a single bit in
a bit mask: the capabilities, and their values and names are shown
below:

<P>
<PRE>
 MGR_SET    0x001  modify list of managers
 MGR_CRCONF 0x002  create new conferences
 MGR_RMCONF 0x004  remove conferences
 MGR_BEORG  0x008  become an organizer of any conference
</PRE>

<P>
There are two CML functions that work with the list of managers
and their capabilities:

<P>
<DL>

<P><DT><A NAME="mgr_list">$mgr_list()</A>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><A 
   HREF="ref402.html#protect">{protected}</A></B>
<DD>
Evaluates to the complete list of managers, in the form &quot;manager1
mask1 manager2 mask2...&quot;.&nbsp;  Each mask is the numeric sum
of that manager's capabilities.

<P><DT><A NAME="mgr_list">$mgr_list(userid)</A>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><A 
   HREF="ref402.html#protect">{protected}</A></B>
<DD>
Evaluates to &quot;userid mask&quot;, where mask is the sum of
that specific manager's capabilities.

</DL>
