<h2>Caucus 5.0 Schema</h2>
Last revised 3/1/2005

<p/>
<b>I. Introduction</b>
<p/>
Caucus 5.0 begins the process of replacing, piece by piece,
the "old" flat-file Caucus database with MySQL.&nbsp;
Each "piece" means applying these five steps:
<ol>
<li>Defining the necessary tables (schema).

<li>Writing code in the CML interpreter that automatically
creates these tables when needed.

<li>Writing new CML functions that use these tables.&nbsp;
Often these are similar in form to the old functions, e.g.
the 'new' $user_info(userid intro) vs the 'old' $per_intro(userid).

<li>Rewriting the relevant CML pages to use the new functions,
or in many cases to use SQL queries to get and display information.

<li>Writing a "translation" CML script that fetches data for an
existing site from the "old" database, and writes it into the
"new" database.
</ol>

<p/>
The rest of this document concerns itself with step #1, the actual
table definitions.&nbsp;
See the CML reference guide for the 
<a href="ref426.html">new CML functions</a>.

<p/>
<b>II. Table Summaries</b>
<p/>
<ol>
<li><b>User Information</b>.<br>
   Information about the user that needs to be accessible by/to people.
  <p/>
  <ul>
  <li><b>user_info</b> - one row per user, one column per user 
       information field.&nbsp;
      When a manager defines a new "master" user information field,
      Caucus adds a new <b>column</b> to this table.
  <li><b>user_columns</b> -- one row per user information field.&nbsp;
     Metadata about the columns in <b>user_info</b>.
  <li><b>user_iface</b> -- one row per field, per interface.&nbsp;
     For each interface, records which fields show up (are accessible)
     on which pages, how, and in what order.&nbsp;
     (This replaces the old way of handling the definition of the
      new user registration page.)
  </ul>

<p/>
<li><b>User "variable" data</b>.<br>
   User "variables" that control or modify the actual operation of
   the software.&nbsp;
   Typically "sparse" data, in that most users do not have values
   for "most" variables.
  <ul>
  <li><b>user_data</b> - one row per user per variable.&nbsp;
     This replaces the old "user variable" concept.
  </ul>

<p/>
<li><b>Tasks data</b>.<br>
  For the new "Tasks" feature.

<p/>
<li><b>Group (access control) data</b>.<br>
<ul>
<li><b>grouprules</b> is the list of rule definitions for all groups
(individual user defined groups, conference groups, manager groups, etc.)
<li><b>groups</b> is the full list of each-user-to-each-group mappings,
entirely derived (compiled, if you will) from the rule set in 
<b>grouprules</b>.&nbsp;
We use <b>groups</b> to actually test for access to any object
controlled by a group, since it's easy to do a JOIN with this table.

</ul>
</ol>

<p/>
<b>III. Table Details</b>
<p/>
While Caucus 5.0 is being built with MySQL, in theory we could use
it with any relational database via ODBC.&nbsp;
For this reason (among others), the precise definition of each
table is <b>not</b> shown below.&nbsp;
Instead, we simply use "varchar" for short strings, "text" for
longer (up to many megabyte) strings, "int" for an integer number,
"dec" for a decimal number, "datetime" for a date and time, etc.&nbsp;
If you need the precise definition, use your MySQL client to
describe a table.

<tr valign=top><td></td>
<td colspan=3><br>
The Tasks table keeps not only a list of all tasks
on the system, but a complete history of every version of every
task.
<p/>
Thus, each task has a unique <b>tid</b>, but each row has a unique
primary key, <b>tkey</b>.&nbsp;
A single task may have many rows with the same <b>tid</b> and
different <b>updated</b>s.&nbsp;
Only the most recent row will have <b>current</b> = 1, all others
will have a value of 0.&nbsp;
(Seems like there ought to be an SQL way to do this by taking the
max() of <b>updated</b>, but w/o sub-queries that may not be possible
or portable.)
<p/>
If a task has been deleted, all its rows will have <b>deleted</b> = 1,
but the rows are still maintained and are in theory still visible
(although certain UI issues, like who is allowed to examine deleted
tasks, need to be resolved).
<p/>
The format of <b>links</b> still needs to be decided on.

<td>0 =&gt; normal, 1 =&gt; this is an "opt (in or out)" rule.</td>

<tr valign=top class="row1"><td></td>
<td>bySelf</td>
<td>int</td>
<td>1 if this rule was added <b>by</b> the user that affects it.</td>

<tr valign=top><td></td>
<td colspan=3><br>
Every group is identified by an owner, and a name.&nbsp;
Userid rules have the userid and wildcard fields, sub-group rules
have the subowner and subname fields.&nbsp;
All rules must have an access level.&nbsp;
An access level of -999 (and no data except
for grkey, owner, and name) acts as a placeholder for
an otherwise "empty" group.
<p/>
Only userid rules may have a non-zero "optional" value.&nbsp;
The optional rules are tricky, see
<a href="c5groups.html">Groups in Caucus 5</a> for more explanation.&nbsp;
Basically they get used in two ways:
<ol>
<li>Group owner defines a rule as optional.&nbsp;
   User does not get access, and is not a member of the group --
   <b>but</b> it allows a user to add themself (add a rule) to the
   group with the identical, non-optional values.&nbsp;
   This is how "opt-in" is implemented.
<li>Group owner grants someone access in a group.&nbsp;
    That "someone" may choose to opt-out, effectively by
    creating an "optional" exclude access rule.
</ol>
In either case, the rule that the user created (not really created
by them, but by a UI in Caucus) is marked as "bySelf".&nbsp;
These rules may always be deleted later, in case the user
decides to undo their opt-in or opt-out, respectively.

<p/>
Whenever a (set of) change(s) has been made to <b>grouprules</b>,
it is the responsibility of the page to call the CML
function $group_update() to force the recompilation of 
(the relevant portions of) the <b>groups</b> table.&nbsp;
This function "locks", so only one process can be updating the
groups table at a time -- other callers will automatically wait
in line.

<tr><td></td>
<td colspan=3><br>
We query <b>groups</b> whenever we need to test access of a specific
userid to a specific group, or (in reverse) for the precise membership of a 
specific group.&nbsp;
<p/>
Note that all userid wildcard rules from <b>grouprules</b> get
expanded into one row in <b>groups</b> per userid that matches
the wildcard!&nbsp;
Thus for many reasons, changing a group is expensive, but checking
access (or membership) is very fast.
