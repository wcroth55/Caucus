<p/>
People (users) are often collected in "groups", which are then
in turn used (primarily) to control access to different objects,
such as conferences, filesafes, etc.&nbsp;
In Caucus 4, groups were simple text files, containing one userid
per line.&nbsp;
In Caucus 5, groups are sets of rules that define which users
have which access permissions to the relevant object.&nbsp;
See <a href="c5groups.html">Caucus Groups in C5</a> for
a more general description.


<dl>
<dt>$group_access (userid gtype gname)
<dd>Evaluates to the (numeric) access level granted to user
<i>userid</i> in group <i>gtype gname</i>.&nbsp;
If the user has no access, or the group does not exist, the
access level is 0.&nbsp;
Group_access() is very fast due to an internal cache, but
its information may be out of date by a maximum of 100 seconds.
<p/>
Groups are defined by a type (e.g. "MGR", "CONF", "Filesafe", "Caucus4",
or a specific userid) and by a name.&nbsp;
Thus, for example, group "MGR systemShutdown" defines the list of 
users who are allowed to shutdown Caucus, and "CONF 12" defines the
list of users with access to conference number 12.
<p/>
The access levels are:
<ul>
<table cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0>
<tr><td>Primary organizer:&nbsp;&nbsp;</td> <td align=right>100</td>
<tr><td>Organizer</td>                <td align=right>40</td>
<tr><td>Instructor</td>               <td align=right>30</td>
<tr><td>Member ("include")</td>       <td align=right>20</td>
<tr><td>Readonly</td>                 <td align=right>10</td>
<tr><td>Exclude</td>                  <td align=right>0</td>
</table>
</ul>

<p/>
<dt>$group_update ($quote(grouptype groupname))
<dd>Updates all of the 'groups' table entries for
"<i>grouptype groupname</i>".&nbsp;
Either $group_update() or $group_update_rule() <b>must</b> be called 
after any changes to the rules
for a particular group (in the grouprules table).&nbsp;
Group_update() is slow but thorough, 
since it completely rebuilds the groups table
entries for a particular group.

<p/>
<dt>$group_update_rule (changeentry $quote(grouptype groupname))
<dd>Updates the 'groups' table entries for group
"<i>grouptype groupname</i>", 
but only updates rows for users that match <i>changeentry</i>.&nbsp;
Changeentry can be a userid, a wildcard, or a $quote()'d group
name.
<p/>
This function is much faster (and thus preferable) if we know
(which we almost always do) which entries have been changed.&nbsp;
E.g. if we add a grouprules row for a specific userid, then call
$group_update_rule() with that userid, etc. etc.

<P><DT><A NAME="peo_members">$peo_members(cnum)</A>
<DD>
Evaluates to a list of userids that are members of conference
<I>cnum</I>.&nbsp;  The userids are sorted by &quot;last name&quot;
of the actual users.

<p/>
   <dt><a name="userids_byid">$userids_byid(match)</a>
   <dd>Evaluates to a list of all of the userids registered with Caucus 
       that begin with the initial substring <i>match</i>.&nbsp;
       If <i>match</i> is empty, evaluates to list of all 
       of the Caucus userids.&nbsp;
       (Even on a site with thousands of users, this function evaluates 
       quickly.)

<P><DT><A NAME="peo_names">$peo_names(cnum word1 [word2])</A>
<DD>
Evaluates to a list of userids of people who match <i>word1</i>
(<b>and</b> <i>word2</i>, if specified).&nbsp;
A person matches if the word(s) are an initial
substring of their first or last name.&nbsp;  If <I>cnum</I> is non-zero,
matching people must also be a member of conference <I>cnum</I>.

   <p/>
   <dt><a name="userids_byname">$userids_byname(x names...)</a>
   <dd>Evaluates to a list of userids of people who match <i>names</i>.&nbsp;
       A person matches if every word in <i>names</i> is an initial substring 
       of some part of their name (including their userid as if it
       were part of their name).&nbsp;
       The <i>x</i> argument is ignored (for now).
   <p/>
   <b>Note:</b>&nbsp;
       Caucus 5 implements this function with a brute-force
       LIKE match and a set of JOINs of user_info against itself.&nbsp;
       On a large site, this may be slow; if so, it can be reimplemented
       as a separate table, with one row per word in the users' names.
   <p/>

<P><DT><A NAME="in_group">$in_group(userid gfile)</A>
<DD>
The In_group function, in combination with the Caucus "groups" files,
acts as a simple kind of ACL (access control list) mechanism.&nbsp;
It evaluates to a number (the "match value") >= 1 
if <I>userid</I> is found or matched 
in group file <I>gfile</I>,
or any group file that <I>gfile</I> in turn includes.&nbsp;
Otherwise "0".

<p>
If <i>userid</i> is found by itself on a line, the match value is 1.&nbsp;
If <i>userid</i> is followed on the same line by a number or numbers, 
the match value is the bitwise "OR" of those numbers.&nbsp;
If <i>userid</i> is followed on the same line by one or more words,
those words are translated into numbers (from the GroupPermNames
parameter in swebd.conf), and then likewise "OR"ed together.

<p>
If the swebd.conf parameter GroupSearch is "ALL", $in_group() searches 
for <b>all</b> possible matches for <i>userid</i>, and similarly 
"OR"s them all together.&nbsp;
Otherwise, $in_group() just returns the <b>first</b> match.&nbsp;

<p>
If you are using $in_group() simply to check if a user is in a group, 
then GroupSearch does not need to be set to "ALL", and in fact Caucus
will run somewhat faster that way.&nbsp;
If, however, you use $in_group() for ACLs, and there's any chance at
all that a userid will be listed more than once, you should definitely
make sure that GroupSearch is set to "ALL".

<P><DT><A NAME="groupperm">$groupperm(permname...)</A>
<DD>
Translates group permission names (as in the groups files used by
<a href="#in_group">$in_group()</a>, above) into their numerical
equivalents.&nbsp;
Evaluates to the bitwise "OR" of the numeric values
(from the swebd.conf parameter GroupPermNames) of the word(s)
in <i>permname</i>.
