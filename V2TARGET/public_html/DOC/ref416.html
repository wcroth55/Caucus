<P><DT><A NAME="t2hbr">$t2hbr(stuff)</A>
<DD>
Turns plain text <I>stuff</I> (which may contain newlines) into
HTML.&nbsp;  It turns each newline into a &lt;BR&gt;.&nbsp;  It also turns
each of the special characters &lt;, &quot;, and &gt; into their
HTML special codes (unless escaped by a &quot;\&quot;).&nbsp;  Example:

<PRE>
  &quot; <B>$t2hbr(</B> $shell(cat mytext) <B>)</B>
</PRE>

displays the text of an ordinary file <I>mytext</I> as HTML.

<P><DT><A NAME="cleanhtml">$cleanhtml(prohibit text)</A>
<DD>
&quot;Clean HTML&quot; filter.&nbsp;  Filters HTML fragment in <I>text</I>,
according to the rules in the string named <I>prohibit</I>.&nbsp;  Provides
a way to filter out certain HTML tags that you may not wish to
be displayed in a response, such as applets, javascript, or even
annoying tags such as &lt;BLINK&gt;.

<P>
Here are the sample contents of a <I>prohibit</I> string:

<P>
<UL>
applet,prohibit,all&nbsp;&nbsp;   script,allow,all&nbsp;&nbsp;   
blink,prohibit,tag
</UL>

<P>
This means that everything between &lt;APPLET&gt; and &lt;/APPLET&gt;
is ignored; that the &lt;SCRIPT&gt; tag is allowed, and the &lt;BLINK&gt;
tag (but only the tag, not the text that follows it) is ignored.&nbsp;
Normally if something is allowed it does not need to be in the
list, but advanced uses of this feature can support lists of tags
that can be individually allowed or prohibited at run time.

<P>
$cleanhtml() includes all of the safety features of $safehtml(),
such as automatic tag closing and mismatched quote correction.

<P><DT><A NAME="safehtml">$safehtml(prop stuff)</A>
<DD>
&quot;Safe HTML&quot; filter.&nbsp;  Obsolete form of $cleanhtml().&nbsp;
Filters HTML fragment in text of <I>stuff</I>, making it &quot;safe&quot;
to include in an existing HTML page.&nbsp;  Specifically, it removes
the tags &lt;HTML&gt;, &lt;/HTML&gt;, &lt;HEAD&gt;, &lt;/HEAD&gt;,
&lt;BODY&gt;, and &lt;/BODY&gt;.&nbsp;  It &quot;closes&quot; any open
tags (such as &lt;B&gt;) that don't have a matching closing tag
(such as &lt;/B&gt;).&nbsp;  It looks for mismatched quotes inside a
tag, and adds an extra quote if necessary.&nbsp;  (For example, &lt;A
HREF=&quot;junk&gt; becomes &lt;A HREF=&quot;junk&quot;&gt;.)

<P>
<I>Prop</I> is a number that controls certain properties of $safehtml().&nbsp;
 It is the sum of a set of bitmasks (powers of 2); each bit controls
a particular property.&nbsp;  The properties are:

<P>
<UL>
  1 allow &lt;FORM&gt;s.&nbsp;   Otherwise &lt;FORM&gt; tags are removed,
like &lt;BODY&gt;.
</UL>

<p/><DT><A NAME="email_wrapper">$email_wrapper(outgoing)</A>
<DD>
Put "magic" wrapper text <b>around</b> email text <i>outgoing</i>.&nbsp;
This wrapper text makes it much easier for <a href="#email_extract">$email_extract()</a>
to detect and remove text that originally came from Caucus, in a replied-to email.

<p/><DT><A NAME="email_extract">$email_extract(incoming)</A>
<DD>
Extract just the new email text from <i>incoming</i> (explain more later).

<P><DT><A NAME="rhtml">$rhtml(stuff)</A>
<DD>
Obsolete form of $safehtml(), without the Prop argument.&nbsp;  $rhtml(stuff)
is equivalent to $safehtml(0 stuff).

<P><DT><A NAME="t2html">$t2html(stuff)</A>
<DD>
Attempts an &quot;intelligent&quot; filtering of plain text stuff
into HTML.&nbsp;  Blank lines become &lt;P&gt;'s.&nbsp;
Parses and translates URL's into anchored links with the same names.&nbsp;
(see $t2url().)

<P><DT><A NAME="t2url">$t2url(stuff)</A>
<DD>
Translates URLs in <I>stuff</I> into anchored links (that pop up a
new window) with the
same names.&nbsp;  Both this function and $t2html() translate URLs that
begin with any of the schemes http:/, gopher:/, telnet:/, ftp:/,
or mailto:.

<P><DT><A NAME="wrap2html">$wrap2html()</A>
<DD>
A more intelligent (than $t2html) filtering of plain text into
HTML.&nbsp;  Acts as much as possible like a typical word-processor.&nbsp;
Each single &quot;hard&quot; RETURN in the original text translates
into a &lt;BR&gt;; multiple RETURNs become sequences of 
&quot;&amp;nbsp;&lt;P&gt;&quot;.&nbsp;
Groups of N spaces become N-1 &quot;&amp;nbsp;&quot;s plus a
regular space.&nbsp;  A tab is treated as a group of 5 spaces.&nbsp;  
Parses and translates URL's into anchored links.

<P>
<B>Special note:</B> All 3 functions also recognize and translate
special &quot;caucus&quot; URLs of the form &quot;http:/caucus...&quot;,
into a reference to a particular Caucus CML page on the current
host (and with the current swebs subserver).&nbsp;  
For example, &quot;http:/caucus&quot;
becomes a reference to the Caucus Center page, i.e. center.cml,
and &quot;http:/caucus/conf_name&quot; becomes a reference to
confhome.cml for conference <I>conf_name</I>.&nbsp;  This is one of
the <B>very</B> few instances in which the CML interpreter assumes
knowledge of the names and arguments of the actual CML files.&nbsp;
(Normally this would be a <B>bad</B> idea, but in this case the
feature is so powerful and useful as to allow the exception.)

<P><DT><A NAME="t2amp">$t2amp(stuff)</A>
<DD>
Translates all &quot;&amp;&quot;s in <I>stuff</I> 
into &quot;&amp;amp;&quot;.&nbsp;
Useful to &quot;pre-escape&quot; HTML code that is going to be
&quot;unescaped&quot; when displayed by a browser.&nbsp;  
(This pre-escaping
is essential when using Caucus to edit a response containing HTML
code.&nbsp;  Without it, any escaped HTML special sequences like 
&quot;&amp;gt;&quot;
would lose their meaning after one edit.)


<P><DT><A NAME="t2esc">$t2esc(stuff)</A>
<DD>
Translates all instances of "&amp;", "&lt;", and "&gt;"
in <I>stuff</I> into their HTML code equivalents 
(<B>&amp;amp; &amp;lt;</B> and <B>&amp;gt;</B>).&nbsp;
Useful to &quot;pre-escape&quot; HTML code that is going to be
&quot;unescaped&quot; when displayed by a browser.&nbsp;  

<P><DT><A NAME="xmlesc">$xmlesc(stuff)</A>
<DD>
Same as $t2esc, but <b>also</b> escapes ASCII characters
with values > (octal) 176 into their entity equivalents.&nbsp;
E.g. octal 177 = hex 8F, which becomes "&amp;#x8f;".&nbsp;
As the name suggests, this encodes character data so that it
may be used in XML.

<P>
<P><DT><A NAME="escquote">$escquote(text) </A>
<DD>
Translates all double-quotes in <I>text</I> to the HTML special
sequence &quot;&amp;quot;&quot;.&nbsp;  This is primarily useful for
placing text (that contains double-quotes) inside a double-quote-delimited
field inside an HTML &lt;INPUT&gt; tag.

<P>
<P><DT><A NAME="escsingle">$escsingle(text) </A>
<DD>
Translates all single quotes in <I>text</I> to the sequence "\'".&nbsp;
(Backslash single-quote).&nbsp;
Also translates all newlines to the sequence "\n" and all
returns to the sequence "\r".&nbsp;
This is primarily useful for
placing text (that contains single quotes) inside a single-quote
delimited string -- a common need, especially inside javascript
inside HTML inside CML.

<P>
<P><DT><A NAME="t2mail">$t2mail(address)</A>
<DD>
Attempts to translate <I>address</I> into a &quot;mailto:&quot;
URL.&nbsp;  (For example, if <I>address</I> is &quot;joe@xyz.com&quot;,
$t2mail() generates &quot;&lt;a 
href=&quot;mailto:joe@xyz.com&quot;&gt;joe@xyz.com&lt;/A&gt;&quot;.)&nbsp;
If <I>address</I> does not appear to be an e-mail address, it
is passed through unchanged.

<P><DT><A NAME="wraptext">$wraptext(width text) </A>
<DD>
Word-wraps <I>text</I> to <I>width</I> (single-width-character)
columns by inserting newlines in the appropriate places.

<P><DT><A NAME="mac_define">$mac_define(name text) </A>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><A 
   HREF="ref402.html#protect">{protected}</A></B>
<DD>
Defines a CML macro <I>name</I> that expands to <I>text</I>.&nbsp;
See the <A HREF="ref31.html">CML macros</A> chapter for more
information.&nbsp;
If <I>name</I> is already defined, the original definition is
erased and replaced by the new one.&nbsp;

<P><DT><A NAME="mac_expand">$mac_expand(text) </A>
<DD>
Expands any macro invocations in <I>text</I>.&nbsp;
Evaluates to <I>text</I>, with the macro invocations replaced by
the expansion of the macros.&nbsp;
See the <A HREF="ref31.html">CML macros</A> chapter for more
information.&nbsp;

<P><DT><A NAME="eval">$eval(text) </A>
<DD>
Evaluates to nothing.&nbsp;
The functional equivalent of the <A HREF="ref5.html#eval">eval</A> 
directive.&nbsp;
Particularly useful in macro definitions when some other function needs
to be evaluated, but the result "thrown away".

<P><DT><A NAME="unhtml">$unhtml(taglist text) </A>
<DD>
Evaluates to <i>text</i>, but with all HTML tags removed.&nbsp;
Tags in <i>taglist</i> are replaced with newlines, all other tags
are replaced with blanks.&nbsp;
<i>Taglist</i> is a comma-separated list of tag names, e.g.
"p,br,tr,ul,ol".

<P><DT><A NAME="url_decode">$url_decode(text) </A>
<DD>
Evaluates to the decoded form of "url encoded" <i>text</i>.

<P><DT><A NAME="h2url">$h2url(text)</A>
<DD>
Looks for URLs in <b>HTML</b> <i>text</i>, and where they are
not part of existing &lt;A HREF...&gt; tags, translates them
into tags that link to those URLs.&nbsp;
Evaluates to the thus-translated value of <i>text</i>.
<p/>
(This function is used, for example, to post-process the output
from the Caucus "richtext" editor, to automatically "blue" URLs
when needed.)

<P><DT><A NAME="addtarget">$addtarget(text)</A>
<DD>
Looks for &lt;A HREF...&gt; tags in HTML <i>text</i>, and
if the referenced URL is something viewable (as defined by 
the New_Win_For parameter in the Caucus swebd.conf configuration
file) and does not have an explict TARGET reference, adds a
TARGET that opens a new window.&nbsp;
Evaluates to the thus-translated value of <i>text</i>.
<p/>
(This is another function that was added to help post-process the
output from the Caucus "richtext" editor.)

<P><DT><A NAME="encode64">$encode64(filename)</A>
<DD>
Evaluates to the base64-encoded contents
of <i>filename</i> (full pathname).&nbsp;
Particularly useful for generating attachments to emails.
