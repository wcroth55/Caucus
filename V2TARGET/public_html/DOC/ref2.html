<P>
The Caucus conferencing system was first released in 1986 as a
text-based, command driven conferencing (groupware) package.&nbsp;
Over the next 8 years, Caucus versions 1 and 2 were extended in
a variety of ways that made it extremely customizable -- but still
fundamentally text-based.

<P>
With the enormous growth of the World Wide Web in 1994-95, it
became clear that a Web-based interface for Caucus could greatly
increase its ease of use, and its popularity.&nbsp;  At the same time,
the Web lacked any significant discussion or conferencing tools,
and it was clear that a Web interface for Caucus could fill this
gap.

<P>
Version 3.0 of Caucus was developed from the ground up as web-based
client-server system.&nbsp;  It was designed to serve Caucus conference
information to an HTTPD server, which in turn feeds HTML to any
Web browser.&nbsp;  But the Caucus server (called "swebs")
needs to know what data to serve, and how (what format) to serve
it in.&nbsp;  This is the purpose of CML.

<P>

CML pages (files) are analogous to HTML pages.&nbsp;  They contain Caucus
directives (e.g., &quot;display the text of such-and-such response)
in an HTML-like format.&nbsp;  They may also contain embedded HTML.

<P>
When a Web user wants to access (or add to) a Caucus conference,
s/he points the browser at a special &quot;entry&quot; HTML page.&nbsp;
This entry page points to a CML page.&nbsp;  (The actual implementation
of &quot;pointing to a CML page&quot; is done via the Web CGI
standard.)&nbsp;
CML pages point to other CML pages, exactly analogous
to the way HTML pages point to other HTML pages.

<P>
When an HTTPD server gets a request for a CML page, it passes
the request on (via CGI) to the Caucus swebs server.&nbsp;  Caucus interprets
the contents of the CML page, <I>producing a dynamic HTML page</I>,
and passes it in turn on to the HTTPD server, which sends it to
the browser.

<P>
