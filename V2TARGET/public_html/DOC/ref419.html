<P>
One of the most challenging tasks in creating sophisticated interfaces
in CML is keeping track of where the user has been.&nbsp;  For example,
a user may start at page A, go to page B to fill out a form, which
in turn is processed by page C... which should return the user
to page A.&nbsp;  If page B may be invoked from many different places,
this task (remembering where to return to after page C) can get
quite complicated.

<P>
<!--
This issue is dealt with more fully in the forthcoming &quot;Caucus
3.1 Programmer's Guide&quot;.&nbsp; -->  
This section details the CML functions
which make this capability possible.

<P>
<DL>

<P><DT><A NAME="page_save">$page_save(refresh cmlfile arglist fragment description)</A>
<DD>
This function &quot;saves&quot; a CML page reference in a table
inside the CML interpreter.&nbsp;  It evaluates to (i.e., returns) a
slot number in that table, which may be used by the other $page_...
functions to access the saved page.&nbsp;  The arguments to $page_save()
define a page reference in such a way that the reference can be
used  later to easily &quot;return to&quot; that page later.

<P>
<I>Cmlfile</I> is the name of the CML file.&nbsp;  <I>Arglist</I> is
the list of arguments to that file that should be remembered.&nbsp;
(<I>Arglist</I> must be one word, so typically the arguments
are specified in their URL form, i.e. with plus signs separating
the individual arguments.)&nbsp;  <I>Fragment</I> is the anchor point
where that document should be re-entered, e.g. &quot;#here&quot;.&nbsp;
(If there is no such anchor point, <I>fragment</I> should just
be &quot;#&quot;.)&nbsp;  <I>Description</I> is just ordinary text that
describes that page; it may be any number of words, including
none.

<P>
The &quot;Caucus Center&quot; page shown in the example CML file
in section 3 uses $page_save() to save the current location in
a table slot:

<P>
<PRE>
set nxt $page_save (1 center.cml \
        $arg(2)+$arg(3)+$arg(4)+$arg(5)+$arg(6)+$arg(7)+$arg(8) \
                # $(center_name) )
</PRE>

<P>

This CML code fragment saves the current page (center.cml), with
its list of arguments ($arg(2)+...), no fragment (&quot;#&quot;),
and a text description (contained inside the variable center_name).&nbsp;
The saved page reference is stored in a slot, and the slot number
is stored (by the &quot;set&quot; statement) in variable <B>nxt</B>.

<P>
The <I>refresh</I> argument is somewhat complicated.&nbsp;  The slot
table in the CML interpreter has a fixed size... which means that
slots that haven't been touched in a while will get automatically
recycled.&nbsp;  <I>Refresh</I> is a number that refers to the arguments
in <I>arglist</I>.&nbsp;  If <I>refresh</I> has a value of N, then the
N'th argument in <I>arglist</I> is assumed to be a slot number,
and that slot is refreshed -- that is, protected from being recycled
until the rest of the slots in the table have been recycled. &nbsp;
See the previously mentioned Programmer's Guide for more information.

<P><DT><A NAME="page_get">$page_get(slot)</A>
<DD>
Evaluates to the entire string saved in <I>slot</I> (by $page_save()).&nbsp;
The first word of the result is the page name, the second word
is the argument list, the third word is the fragment (anchor name,
with &quot;#&quot;), and the fourth through last words are the
page description.

<P><DT><A NAME="page_return">$page_return(slot&nbsp; #override&nbsp; empty)</A>
<DD>
Evaluates to a string that can be used in an HTTP &quot;Location:&quot;
directive to &quot;return to&quot; a page saved in <I>slot</I>.&nbsp;
<I>#override</I> is a fragment anchor that may be used to override
the anchor that was saved (with $page_save()).&nbsp;  If it is just
&quot;#&quot;, the original (saved) anchor is used, otherwise
<I>#override</I> is used.&nbsp;  <I>Empty</I> should be a full CML page
reference, to be used only if there is no page saved at slot.

<P>
Here is an example from the Caucus 3.1 additemf.cml file, which
processes adding a new item to a conference, and then returns
to the page which invoked &quot;create a new item&quot;:

<P>
<PRE>
   &quot;Location: $(href)/$page_return($arg(2) # \
                           center.cml?$(nch)+0+x+x+x+x+x+x)
</PRE>

<P>
In this case, $arg(2) is the slot number of the page that originally
invoked &quot;create a new item&quot;.&nbsp;  There is no override on
the saved fragment anchor, and the default page (in case there
was no saved &quot;calling&quot; page) is center.cml, the &quot;Caucus
Center&quot;  page.

<P><DT><A NAME="page_caller">$page_caller(which slot)</A>
<DD>
Evaluates to the slot number of the page which &quot;called&quot;
the page saved at <I>slot</I>.&nbsp;  Assumes that the caller of a page
is stored in the argument list to that page, in argument number
<I>which</I>.
