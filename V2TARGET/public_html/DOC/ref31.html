<P>
CML provides a "macro" capability that may be used by both
the CML code developer or the end user alike.&nbsp;
It is similar to the macro capability in the C language, 
or the functions that can be created in the Korn and
other Unix shells.

<P>
A macro is just a shortcut, a way of representing a longer string
of HTML and/or CML functions, with arguments that are expanded
when the macro is evaluated.&nbsp;

<P>
Macros are defined by the CML function
<A HREF="ref416.html#mac_define">$mac_define()</A>;
they are automatically evaluated (or "expanded") by the CML
interpreter.&nbsp;
They may also be expanded with the 
<A HREF="ref416.html#mac_expand">$mac_expand()</A> function,
which is particularly useful when the macro reference is contained in
a CML variable, or returned by a CML function.&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;<BR>
<B>3.1.1 HTML Example</B><BR>
Here's a simple example of defining and using a macro that just
acts as an HTML shortcut:

<P>
<PRE>
   eval $mac_define (image &lt;IMG SRC="@1" WIDTH=@2 HEIGHT=@3&gt;)

   %image (myimage.gif 64 32)
</PRE>

<P>
The invocation of the "%image", above, expands to:

<P>
<PRE>
   &lt;IMG SRC="myimage.gif" WIDTH=64 HEIGHT=32&gt;
</PRE>

<P>
Note that the "@1" in the macro definition represents the first word
(or argument) in the macro invocation, "@2" the second word, and so on.&nbsp;
Macros support nine arguments, "@1" through "@9", plus the special
argument "@@", which expands to the complete list of words in the macro
invocation, no matter how many there are.


<P>&nbsp;<BR>
<B>3.1.2 CML Example</B><BR>
Here's a more interesting macro definition.&nbsp;
(It assumes some knowledge of the CML functions
<A HREF="ref405.html#if">$if()</A>,
<A HREF="ref405.html#equal">$equal()</A>, and
<A HREF="ref410.html#per_name">$per_name()</A>.)

<P>
The "namer" macro displays the full name of a person, 
given their userid as the single argument -- for example,
when invoked as <TT>%namer(roth)</TT>.&nbsp;
But if that userid is <I>this</I> person (i.e., the current user), then
the name is shown as blinking text.

<P>
<PRE>
   eval $mac_define (namer \$if (\$equal ($userid() @1) &lt;BLINK&gt;)\
                                 \$per_name(@1)&lt;/BLINK&gt;)
</PRE>

<P>
Note the use of the backslash ("\") to "escape" some of the CML
functions.&nbsp;
The backslash is removed during the definition of the macro, 
but it prevents the functions from being evaluated <I>during</I>
the macro definition.&nbsp;
Instead, those functions are evaluated only when the macro is
actually expanded.
<P>
For example, the $userid() function has no backslash, 
and thus <I>is</I> evaluated immediately,
and becomes a constant part of the macro definition.&nbsp;
This is fine, since the userid
is constant during the entire Caucus session.&nbsp;
$per_name(), on the other hand, is escaped with a backslash.&nbsp;
It must be evaluated during the
macro expansion -- otherwise the definition would be attempting
to find the name of the person called "@1"!

<P>&nbsp;<BR>
<B>3.1.3 Macro expansion and CML evaluation</B><BR>
As stated in the previous section,
when macros are expanded, any CML functions in the definition
are automatically evaluated.&nbsp;

<P>
The reverse, however, is not true.&nbsp;
If a CML function evaluates to a macro invocation, that macro
is not automatically expanded.&nbsp;
(Only macro invocations in the original CML source code are
automatically expanded.)

<P>
To expand a macro that results from a CML function evaluation,
use the 
<A HREF="ref416.html#mac_expand">$mac_expand()</A> function.&nbsp;

<P>
For example, here is an actual line of CML code from the page
that displays the responses to an item:
<P>
<FONT SIZE=-1>
<PRE>
   "$cleanhtml (prohibited $protect($mac_expand($wrap2html($re_text()))))
</PRE>
</FONT>

<P>
Now suppose that the particular response from 
<A HREF="ref414.html#re_text">$re_text()</A> is "word-wrapped"
text that contains
a macro invocation, such as the "%image" macro from 3.1.1.&nbsp;
Consider how that text is processed by the functions in this line.&nbsp;
<A HREF="ref416.html#wrap2html">$wrap2html()</A>
just handles word-wrapping and quoting of special
HTML characters; it doesn't affect the macro.
<P>
Then <A HREF="ref416.html#mac_expand">$mac_expand()</A> actually 
expands the macro, which can contain
any CML functions, <I>and evaluates them</I>.&nbsp;
(Note that it only evaluates CML functions that are within
the expansion of the macro.&nbsp;
Any other instances of CML functions in the argument text
of $mac_expand() are left unevaluated.)
<P>
While this is very powerful, it can also be dangerous to allow any
user to evaluate any CML function that might be in a macro.&nbsp;
So <A HREF="ref402.html#protect">$protect()</A> disables the effect 
of any CML functions that are considered "unsafe".&nbsp;
And finally, 
<A HREF="ref416.html#cleanhtml">$cleanhtml()</A> removes or 
hides any HTML tags that
the Caucus manager or conference organizer has chosen to be
prohibited, even if they were in the original macro definition.



<P>&nbsp;<BR>
<B>3.1.4 Nested Macros</B><BR>
Macros may use other macros in their definitions.&nbsp;
Here is a very simple example that just uses HTML:
<P>
<PRE>
   "eval $mac_define (tag B)
   "eval $mac_define (emphasize &lt;%tag()&gt;@@&lt;/%tag()&gt;)

   "Some words deserve %emphasize(special) emphasis!
</PRE>

<P>
And it produces the text "Some words deserve <B>special</B> emphasis!".&nbsp;
But, if instead we use backslashes to "escape" the invocations of %tag
in the definition of %emphasize:
<P>
<PRE>
   "eval $mac_define (emphasize &lt;\%tag()&gt;@@&lt;/\%tag()&gt;)
</PRE>

<P>
Now the expansion of %tag is delayed until the expansion of
%emphasize.&nbsp;
This means that if we redefine %tag later on, %emphasize will
use the new definition of %tag.

<P>
Macros may also use other macros in their expansion, 
in the same way that CML functions may call other CML
functions as their arguments.&nbsp;
Here is another simple HTML-only example:

<P>
<PRE>
   "eval $mac_define (bold   &lt;B&gt;@@&lt;/B&gt;)
   "eval $mac_define (italic &lt;I&gt;@@&lt;/I&gt;)

   "Some words get %bold(%italic(double)) emphasis!
</PRE>
<P>
Which produces "Some words get <B><I>double</I></B> emphasis!".
