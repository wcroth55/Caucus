<P>
Caucus 4.4 and 4.6 expanded the possibilies for how to do
user authentication and authorisation.&nbsp;
"Authentication" is the way that the user provides his or
her identity (userid and password) to the Caucus software.&nbsp;
"Authorisation" is the way that Caucus verifies the user
is really who they say they are (validate userid and password
against a known source of information).
<p>
There are basically three methods for handling authentication:
<ol>
<li><b>Web-server basic authentication</b>.&nbsp;
This is the original Caucus method, in which
authentication is done entirely by the web server.
<p>
The Caucus pages are run from a "protected" directory, 
which means that the web server insists that a user be 
authorised before they can see those pages.&nbsp;
The server sends an authentication request to the browser,
which pops up a (built-in) userid and password dialog box.&nbsp;
The userid and password are sent back to the server via
environment variables, and the server then compares them to
its authorisation source (typically a 'passwd' file).
<p>
If the user is authorised, then the server displays the pages.&nbsp;
The browser caches the userid and password, and sends them along
with every request for a page in the protected directory.

<p>
<li><b>Cookie-based Caucus authentication</b>.&nbsp;
This is new in Caucus 4.4.
<p>
In this method, the user arrives at a Caucus 'login' page,
which prompts for userid and password.&nbsp;
Caucus checks the values against its authorisation source,
currently via the function 
<a href="ref421.html#pw_verify">$pw_verify()</a>,
and if they pass, it sends a cookie to the browser that
identifies the user as authorised for the duration of this
Caucus session.
<p>
All subsequent requests for Caucus pages send the cookie
to the server, which ensures that the userid is constant
throughout the session.&nbsp;
<p>
Note that Caucus cookies are kept (only) in the browser's
memory, they are <b>not</b> written to the user's hard
drive.&nbsp;
(For more information about cookies, see
<a href="http://wp.netscape.com/newsref/std/cookie_spec.html"
   >wp.netscape.com/newsref/std/cookie_spec.html</a>.)

<p/>
<li><b>External cookie-based authentication.</b>&nbsp;
This is new in Caucus 4.6.
<p/>
In this method, it is assumed that some other application has 
<b>already</b> gone through the authentication and authorisation
process.&nbsp;
But that other application needs to pass the authenticated userid
on to Caucus, in a way that cannot be spoofed.&nbsp;
Here's how it works:
<p/>
<ol type="a">
<li>The original application computes the MD5 hash of 
the string "<i>userid</i>,<i>secret</i>", where <i>userid</i>
is the authenticated userid, and <i>secret</i> is some secret
word.
<p/>
<li>The original application writes a cookie called CAUCUSID,
with the value "<i>userid</i>+<i>hash</i>", 
where <i>hash</i> is the 32 character
hexadecimal encoding of the MD5 hash from the previous step.
<p/>
<li>The Caucus configuration file swebd.conf contains the 
parameter setting:
<pre>
   Auth3Tag  <i>secret</i>
</pre>

<p/>
<li>The original application directs the user's browser to
a URL of the form
<pre>
   http://localhost/sweb/swebsock/0/0/CC44/main/center.cml?0+0+x+x+x+x+x+x
</pre>
(See the caucus.html file to determine the precise URL, except that
the above link must terminate in "center.cml" as shown.)
<p/>
<li>Caucus decodes the userid from the CAUCUSID cookie, and
does its own calculation of the MD5 hash, to ensure that the
userid has not been spoofed.
</ol>
<p/>
Note that you may completely disable this method by providing 
an Auth3Tag without a value, in swebd.conf.

</ol>

<p>
In all three methods, when a user is authorised, their userid is
provided by the $userid() function (inside a CML page).

<p>
The rest of this page describes the functions that are used
to provide and extend cookie-based authentication.


<DL>

<p>
<dt><a name="auth_method">$auth_method()</a>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><A 
   HREF="ref402.html#protect">{protected}</A></B>
<dd>Evaluates to a number that indicates the authentication method
currently in use (as described above):
<ul>
0 = None (not authorised)<br>
1 = Basic authentication (http_remote_user)<br>
2 = Session-cookie based authentication<br>
3 = External application CAUCUSID cookie<br>
4 = No supplied userid, "<guest>" login (leading G in pid code in URL).
</ul>

<P><DT><A NAME="auth_cookie">$auth_cookie (userid [path])</A> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><A 
   HREF="ref402.html#protect">{protected}</A></B>
<dd>For authentication method 2 <b>only</b>.&nbsp;
Once the user has passed the 'login' page described above,
use $auth_cookie() to generate the proper cookie(s) and send
them to the browser.&nbsp;
<p>
The call to $auth_cookie() should follow a "Location:" or
"Content-type" HTTP header directive, but should appear 
before the blank line that signals the end of the directive.
<p>
<i>Userid</i> is the user's userid.&nbsp;
<i>Path</i> is the URL directory path for which the cookie
applies; a typical value would be the string 
"/$(sweb)/swebsock", which means the cookie is good
for any page in Caucus, regardless of interface directory.
<p>
<b>Note:</b> you should also call $auth_cookie <i>without arguments</i>
to "log out" -- it sets the Caucus cookies to appropriate "garbage"
values that un-authenticate, so to speak, the user.&nbsp;
Do this (the "logout") for <b>both</b> authentication method 2 <b>and</b>
method 3.

<p>
<dt><a name="auth_pw">$auth_pw ([password])</a>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><A 
   HREF="ref402.html#protect">{protected}</A></B>
<dd>For authentication method 2 <b>only</b>.&nbsp;
$auth_pw() provides a way to save and retrieve the user's
   password for future use, such as implementing "single-signon"
   with another web tool from inside Caucus.
<p>
Call $auth_pw (password) to save the user's <i>password</i>
immediately after verifying (authorising) it.&nbsp;
This stores the password in the server's memory, but not on disk,
and in a way that is not accessible by Caucus users (even if they
are allowed to put CML text in their items and responses).
<p>
Call $auth_pw() (without an argument) to get the saved password
(as the value of the function).&nbsp;
