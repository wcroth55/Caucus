<p/>
In Caucus 5.1, one "gets" most item and response information 
via direct SQL queries.&nbsp;
"Setting", creating, or changing items or responses is, 
on the other hand, usually done
through CML "service" functions, since the required data changes
may cover many tables.

<p/>
Conferences are referred to by their key number, typically called
"cnum".&nbsp;
Items, on the other hand, are referred to by <b>either</b>
their unique key number (typically "id"),
<b>or</b> their label, aka item number, depending on context.&nbsp;
An item number is a "dotted" concatentation of (up to) 6 levels.&nbsp;
For example:
<ul>
<li>5 is item 5.
<li>2.1 is the first "breakout" item (thread) under top level item 2.
<li>1.1.3.1 is the first breakout under the 3rd breakout under the 
   first breakout under top level item 1.
</ul>
Each "breakout" or "thread" is its own standalone item, with a linear
thread of responses attached to it, in sequential order.&nbsp;
But new breakout items or threads may split off from any response,
and get their own new item number.&nbsp;

<p/>
Internally (in the item-related database tables), each item has its
own unique key, called item_id.&nbsp;
This key never changes.&nbsp;
Item numbers (labels) may change, i.e. it is possible to renumber
an item, move it up and down in the breakout hierarchy, or even "share"
the same item in multiple conferences.

<p/>
Responses have a two-part key: the item_id (for the item the response
"belongs to"), and the response number (rnum).&nbsp;
The response number is also used as the label,
which tells you where the response
appears within an item.&nbsp;
Response numbers (and keys) never change.

<p/>
The rest of this document describes the item and response CML service
functions.

<dl>

<p/>
<dt><a name="item_add"
   >$item_add (cnum iparent rparent userid title...)</a>
<dd>Creates a new item in conference <i>cnum</i>.&nbsp;
If <i>iparent</i> is zero, the new item is assigned the next top-level item
number in that conference.&nbsp;
Otherwise, the new item becomes the next breakout item under
item id <i>iparent</i>, and is attached to response number 
<i>rparent</i>.
<p/>
The item's author is set to <i>userid</i>, 
and is given title <i>title</i>.&nbsp;
Note that this creates an empty item, with a title but no text.&nbsp;
Use $resp_add() to add the text of response 0, i.e. the item text proper.
<p/>
Evaluates to the new item's id, or to a negative error code
if the item could not be created.

<p/>
<dt><a name="item_del">$item_del (cnum item_id)</a>
<dd>Delete item <i>item_id</i> in conference <i>cnum</i>.&nbsp;
This <b>permanently</b> deletes the item and <b>all</b> of its responses,
and <b>all</b> of its subitems(!).&nbsp;
Thus deleting item (with label) 1 also deletes items labelled 
1.1, 1.2, 1.1.1, etc., and all of
<b>their</b> responses.
<p/>
Exception: if an item is shared across multiple conferences, deleting
it from a conference only removes it from that conference -- it still
exists in the other conferences.&nbsp;
When the last conference deletes it, only then will the item
completely disappear.


<p/>
<dt><a name="item_id">$item_id (cnum inum)</a>
<dd>Evaluates to the item id (items.id) value of an item in
conference <i>cnum</i>, with item label <i>inum</i>.

<p/>
<dt><a name="item_parse">$item_parse (cnum text)</a>
<dd>Parses <i>text</i> into a triplet-list of conference number,
item id, and response number.&nbsp;
<i>Text</i> may be:
<ul>
<li>An item label, with an optional ":" followed
by a response number.&nbsp;
An item label may use one or more '*' wildcards, e.g.
5.* is items 5.1, 5.2, etc.&nbsp;
5.*.2:1 is response 1 to items 5.1.2, 5.2.2, etc.
<li>A string of words in the title of one or more items.
</ul>
<p/>
If there is an error, it will evaluate to a single negative number.&nbsp;
If there are no matches, the result will be empty.

<p/>
<dt><a name="item_label">$item_label (cnum item_id)</a>
<dd>Evaluates to the item label of an item <i>item_id</i> in
conference <i>cnum</i>.

<p/>
<dt><a name="item_lastresp">%item_lastresp (item_id)</a>
<dd>Evaluates to the number of the last response to <i>item_id</i>.
<p/>
<b>Note: this is a macro!</b>  Eventually it should probably
be (part of) a service function.

<p/>
<dt><a name="item_tuplet">$item_tuplet (i0 i1 i2 i3 i4 i5)</a>
<dd>In the database, the item level (breakout) numbers are actually represented
as 6 integer fields, item0 through item 5.&nbsp;
(Which means that 6 levels is as deep as breakouts can go.)&nbsp;
Occasionally it is necessary to translate from this set of (up to) 6
integers into the "dotted" item number format.
<p/>
So this function evaluates to the dotted form of this list of
(up to) 6 space-separated integers, e.g. <nobr>"$item_tuplet(1 4 3)"</nobr>
evaluates to 1.4.3.

<p/>
<dt><a name="item_set">$item_set (cnum item_id property value)
<dd>Sets the <i>property</i> of the specified <i>item_id</i> to 
<i>value</i>, as below:
<ul>
<table cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0>
<tr><td><b>property</b>&nbsp;</td>
<td><b>value</b></td>

<tr><td>hidden</td>   <td>1 (true), 0 (false)</td>
<tr><td>retired</td>   <td>1, 0</td>
<tr><td>frozen</td>   <td>1, 0</td>
<tr><td>userid</td>   <td>new owner userid</td>
</table>
</ul>

<p/>
<dt><a name="item_set_seen">$item_set_seen (cnum item_id userid respseen)
<dd>Marks response <i>respseen</i> in conference <i>cnum</i>, 
item <i>item_id</i>,
as "seen" by user <i>userid</i>.&nbsp;
A <i>respseen</i> value of -1 marks the item as completely new,
a value of -2 marks the item as "forgotten".

<p/>
<dt><a name="resp_add">$resp_add (cnum item_id userid property 
          bits reserved text..)</a>
<dd>Adds a response to <i>cnum</i>, <i>item_id</i>, with author <i>userid</i>,
text type <i>property</i>, and options <i>bits</i>.&nbsp;
(See <a href="prop.html">property values</a> for a description
of the property and bits values.)&nbsp;
<i>Reserved</i> is reserved for future expansion; for now, set it to 0.&nbsp;
And <i>text</i> is the actual text of the new response.
<p/>
Evaluates to the new response number in the item.

<p/>
<dt><a name="resp_set">$resp_set (item_id rnum field value)</a>
<dd>Sets (changes) the <i>value</i> of some <i>field</i> for 
response <i>item_id</i>, <i>rnum</i>.&nbsp;
The field/value pairs are:
<ul>
<table cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0>
<tr><td><b>Field</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
<td><b>Value</b></td>

<tr valign=top><td>time&nbsp;</td>
<td>Date/time stamp of response, as "YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS".</td>

<tr valign=top><td>userid&nbsp;</td>
<td>Userid of owner of response.</td>

<tr valign=top><td>text&nbsp;</td>
<td>Text of response.</td>

<tr valign=top><td>prop&nbsp;</td>
<td>Text property (type) number</td>
</table>
</ul>

<p/>
<dt><a name="resp_del">$resp_del (cnum item_id rnum)</a>
<dd>Deletes response <i>cnum</i>, <i>item_id</i>, <i>rnum</i>.

</dl>

<hr>
<b>These are the old, 4.x item-related CML functions.&nbsp;</b>
They are here for reference, and for conversion tools that map 4.x
data into 5.1 data.&nbsp;
Eventually they will disappear all together.
<p/>
<DL>
<P><DT><A NAME="it_member">$it_member(cnum)</A>
<DD>
Evaluates to &quot;1&quot; if the current user has a participation
record in the conference (that which tracks items seen vs new).&nbsp;
A person may be a member of a conference (in the sense that there
is a 'grouprules' table rule that grants them access to the conference)
but not (yet) have a participation record.&nbsp;
<p/>
The name is a historical accident due to how membership was handled
in Caucus 4.

<P><DT><A NAME="it_last">$it_last(cnum)</A>
<DD>
Evaluates to the number of the last item in a conference, i.e.,
the number of items.

<P><DT><A NAME="it_inew">$it_inew(cnum)</A>
<DD>
Evaluates to the number of new (and undeleted) items in a conference.

<P><DT><A NAME="it_wnew">$it_wnew(cnum)</A>
<DD>
Evaluates to the number of items that have 1 or more new responses.

<P><DT><A NAME="it_iunseen">$it_iunseen(cnum)</A>
<DD>
Evaluates to the number of unseen items.

<P><DT><A NAME="it_listrnew">$it_listrnew(cnum)</A>
<DD>
Evaluates to a &quot;triplet&quot; list of the new responses
in a conference.&nbsp;  The response number in a triplet is the first
new response in the relevant item.

<P><DT><A NAME="it_listiunseen">$it_listiunseen(cnum)</A>
<DD>
Evaluates to a &quot;triplet&quot; list of the unseen items in
a conference.&nbsp;  The response number is always 0.

<P><DT><A NAME="it_exists">$it_exists(cnum inum)</A>
<DD>
Evaluates to &quot;1&quot; if the item exists and the 
user is a member of the conference, and &quot;0&quot;
otherwise.

<P><DT><A NAME="it_visib">$it_visib(cnum inum)</A>
<DD>
Evaluates to &quot;1&quot; if the item is visible to the user,
i.e. has not been deleted,  not &quot;forgotten&quot;, 
and not "hidden".&nbsp;  Otherwise &quot;0&quot;.

<P><DT><A NAME="it_new">$it_new(cnum inum)</A>
<DD>
Evaluates to &quot;1&quot; if the item is new to this user, i.e.
it has a higher number than the highest item the user has seen.&nbsp;
Otherwise &quot;0&quot;.

<P><DT><A NAME="it_unseen">$it_unseen(cnum inum)</A>
<DD>
Evalutates to &quot;1&quot; if this item is not new but has not
been seen by the user.&nbsp;  Otherwise &quot;0&quot;.

<P><DT><A NAME="it_resps">$it_resps(cnum inum)</A>
<DD>
Evaluates to the number of responses.&nbsp;  If the item does not exist
(or was deleted), evaluates to -1.&nbsp;  An item without any responses
evaluates to &quot;0&quot;.

<P><DT><A NAME="it_lastresp">$it_lastresp(cnum inum)</A>
<DD>
Evaluates to the number of the last (undeleted) response
to the item.&nbsp;  If the item does not exist
(or was deleted), evaluates to -1.&nbsp;

<P><DT><A NAME="it_newr">$it_newr(cnum inum)</A>
<DD>
Evaluates to the number of the first response on this item that
is <I>new</I> to this user.&nbsp;  If no responses are new, evaluates
to the number of responses + 1.

<P><DT><A NAME="it_frozen">$it_frozen(cnum inum)</A>
<DD>
Evaluates to &quot;1&quot; if the item is frozen, and &quot;0&quot;
otherwise.

<P><DT><A NAME="it_howmuch">$it_howmuch(cnum inum userid)</A>
<DD>
Evaluates to the number of responses seen by user <I>userid</I>
to item <I>inum</I> in conference <I>cnum</I>.&nbsp;  A value of -1
means the item is new to that user; -2 means the user has forgotten
that item.

<P><DT><A NAME="it_parse">$it_parse(cnum text)</A>
<DD>
Evaluates to a triplet list of item/response numbers in conference
<I>cnum</I> that match, in some form, <I>text</I>.&nbsp;  <I>Text</I>
may contain a variety of forms of listing items, separated by
commas, including the example shown below.&nbsp;  
The result is an &quot;or&quot;
match, i.e. all the items that match all the entries in <I>text</I>.

<PRE>
  5
  7-20
  key words in an item title
  &quot;words in one item title&quot;, &quot;words in another item title&quot;
  author &quot;charles roth&quot;
  since 5/23/95
  since -4
</PRE>

<P><DT><A NAME="it_pack">$it_pack(cnum comma triplet(s))</A>
<DD>
Acts as the inverse of $it_parse(), i.e. it converts a triplet list
of items into text representing item ranges.&nbsp;  Items in triplets
that are not in conference <I>cnum</I> are ignored.&nbsp;
A <I>comma</I> value of 1 means add a comma and a space between items
or item ranges; 0 means just use a space.

<P>
Example: $it_pack (3 1&nbsp;&nbsp; 3 12 0&nbsp;&nbsp; 3 13 0&nbsp; 
  3 14 0&nbsp;&nbsp;
 2 5 1&nbsp;&nbsp; 3 1 5)<BR> produces "1, 12-14".

<P><DT><A NAME="it_hidden">$it_hidden(cnum inum)</A>
<DD>Is conference <i>cnum</i> item <i>inum</i> hidden?&nbsp;
Evaluates to 1 if hidden, 2, if "retired", or
0 if not hidden or does not exist, not
accessible, etc.

</DL>

<P>
Note: to ease the writing (and reading) of CML pages, all of the
$it_ functions that take two arguments (such as 
<A HREF="#it_visib">it_visib()</A>, 
<A HREF="#it_resps">it_resps()</A>, and
<A HREF="#it_newr">it_newr()</A>) 
may be written with <I>no</I> arguments.&nbsp;  This
means &quot;re-use the exact same arguments as in a previous instance
of one of these functions&quot;.&nbsp;  <B>Warning</B>: results may
be unpredictable if other $it_...() functions (those with more
than two arguments) are called in between.
