<b>Notes:</b>&nbsp;
 "Quizzes" are a new feature in Caucus 5.0, intended to round  out the e-Learning side of Caucus discussions.&nbsp;  The basic use-case model goes like this:  <ol>  <li>Quizzes are just another type of item.&nbsp;  They belong to a conference, and have the same kind of access control  as a regular ("discussion") item.  <li>Quizzes are created and edited by organizers (or instructors).  <li>Quizzes have a list of editable properties, such as title, when the quiz  is available to be taken, etc.  <li>Generally it is assumed that the quizzes are meant to be "taken"  by the regular ("include" level) members, although the organizers may  also "take" their own quizzes.  <li>Quizzes in turn contain a list of "Problems".&nbsp;  Each Problem is a single question, with an optional list of  answers.&nbsp;  A problem may be "in" one or more Quizzes, but every Problem must  appear in at least one Quiz.&nbsp;  Problems can be moved around, or copied, to different Quizzes.  <li>Quiz takers have a record of their "Score(s)", identified by Quiz and  Problem.&nbsp;  Takers can only see their own Scores, organizers can see all the scores  for all quizzes in the conference.  <li>Quizzes do not have discussion, although one can add a "breakout"  discussion item to a quiz item (or vice versa).  <li>Quizzes have 4 states, which appear as icons in the "new" column  of the conference home page item list:  <ul>  <li>"New" -- never seen.  <li>Open circle -- seen but no answers saved.  <li>Half-filled circle -- some or all answers saved.  <li>Filled-in circle -- quiz scored.  </ul>  </ol>
