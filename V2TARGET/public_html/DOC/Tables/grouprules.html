<b>Notes:</b>&nbsp;
 Every group is identified by an owner, and a name.  Userid rules have the userid and wildcard fields, sub-group rules have the  subowner and subname fields.  All rules must have an access level.  An access  level of -999 (and no data except for grkey, owner, and name) acts as a  placeholder for an otherwise "empty" group.  <p/>Only userid rules may have a non-zero "optional" value.  The optional rules  are tricky, see <a href="../c5groups.html">Groups in Caucus 5</a>  for more explanation.  Basically they get used in two ways:  <ul>  <li>Group owner defines a rule as optional.  User does not get access, and is not  a member of the group -- but it allows a user to add themself (add a rule) to the  group with the identical, non-optional values.  This is how "opt-in" is implemented.  <li>Group owner grants someone access in a group.  That "someone" may choose to  opt-out, effectively by creating an "optional" exclude access rule. /* </ul>  In either case, the rule that the user created (not really created by them, but  by a UI in Caucus) is marked as "bySelf".  These rules may always be deleted later,  in case the user decides to undo their opt-in or opt-out, respectively.  <p/>Whenever a (set of) change(s) has been made to grouprules, it is the  responsibility of the page to call the CML function $group_update() to force the  recompilation of (the relevant portions of) the groups table.  This function "locks",  so only one process can be updating the groups table at a time -- other callers  will automatically wait in line.
